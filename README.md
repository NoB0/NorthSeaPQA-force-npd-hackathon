# FORCE NPD LLM Hackathon

This repository contains data and code produced during the FORCE NPD LLM Hackathon.

During this hackathon, we worked on two tasks:

  - The generation of Question-Answer (QA) pairs from documents related to the oil and gas domain. More details on the newly created dataset NorthSeaPQA can be found [here](code/qa_generation/README.md).
  - The classification of passages from the same documents. More details are available [here](code/classifier/README.md).
