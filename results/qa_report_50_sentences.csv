41,DISCOVERY_EVALUATION_REPORT,601b0da72cc6a2ec5015e66636cd167a4d3802fb,4,"The level belongs to the Brent formation and consists of fine to medium coarse sand interspersed with shale and coal stringers. Porosity goes up to 25% and permeability is in the 500md range. The sand was found oil-bearing on the upper 11m. On the lower part oil shows where observed during coring, in contradiction with the logs, but testing eventually proved the lower part to contain water (DST2). DST3, performed in the oil zone yielded 74m3/day of light oil, GOR=2500. water rate of 384m3/day. As the test took place under difficult conditions, the samples and PVT analysis can not be considered as representative. However, it is noted here that the produced gas contained about mol% CO2. FIT 10 run in the water zone recovered filtrate only. DST2, as mentioned, recovered water, salinity is 59 9/1. Level II This level, and also all the following ones, belong to the Statfjord formation, and are separated from the Brent by 65m of Dunline shale. The sand is medium to coarse, interspersed with shale and coal, some calcareous cementation. Porosity is about 20%, average permeability in the 100 md range for the whole sand. The upper 4.5m contains gas; as for Brent oil shows where observed in the lower zone, but the logs, which indicate water, where verified by DST1 producing water. Water salinity: 64 9/1. Further testing confirmed the presence of condensate gas in the upper section (FIT8) and of oil in the median zone (F1T9). The oil from FIT9 is rater heavy, with GOR of 300.I. -6- The fluids from FIT have not been properly analysed for thermodynamic data, however it has been established that the fluid is wet gas which is probably below the dew-point pressure. Levels III-IV-V and VIII These sand layers where all found to be water bearing, except some dissolved gas in water from level V. Porosity is about 20% in all the layers, permeability is best in levels III and V, in the range of 250 md. Level VI This is rather thin sand layer, entirely gas bearing, from which condensate gas was recovered by FIT sampling. Porosity from logs is about 20%, no cores. Level VII A sand layer with 1.5m of gas on top. No cores, no fluid sample. Log porosity is approximately 20%.-7- 1* 4.i Geophysical evaluation Geophysical interpretation of the E-structure has shown the Statfjord formation to be most interesting, since Brent formation is eroded upwards. The best isobath map available is tentative interpretation of top of Statfjord and is given in appendix E. The Statfjord layers dip about 20 * to the west and has top of hydrocarbons at 3170 in MSL. considerable uncertainty pertains to the extent of the eroded area to the SE of 25/4-1 location.-8- 5. Fluid analysis results The fluid samples gathered from the Jurassic are summarized in table 3. The main results, which are scarce, are collected in table 4. The following comments are appropriate. DST1 + 2: Run in base of level II and respectively to confirm presence of . water. Water analyses completed. DST3 : Run in the oil zone of level II, this test yielded high GOR oil, and water probably by channeling. Several difficulties during the test make the samples unreliable: not stabilized flow samples taken only hours after choke change - short cleaning period water production by channelling probably On this background, the PVT-results can not be considered as representative. Another ambiguity is introduced by the fact that the PVT-report describes the fluid as condensate gas with an initial condensate content of 200 g/m3. The main data from the analysis is given in table 4. As mentioned, nothing can be definitely concluded. FIT : Run in level VI; gas, condensate and filtrate recovered, confirming presence of wet gas. The analyses performed are distillation and composition. The only interesting result from reservoir point of view, is condensate density of g/cc and free gas gravity of .63.

At the WOC (-3167.6m BSL) static pressure will be: ps = bars The gradient in the water zone, based on two points only, will be: 1.99 bar/10 This is improbably high.

Dear Mr. Roberts, a Because it ia almost certain that only very short time will be available for review prior to reaching decision relocating another stepout after 25/10-3, we are outlining some general alternative,' and objectives which have resulted from discussions between Sangre, Shannon, EPRCo. engineers and ourselves.

The model was constructed using the same princi- ' 0114- plea as the previous one, ie., horizontal 0-W con tact and the sands ' yi.- paralleling the Eocene Rex structure contours. The net sand iso- .'i'll'i . ,4 pachs were constructed using consorvative approach to the environ- L mental interpretation. Copies of the two key net oil sand isopach  soNs t, , .0,',Amodele are included for your information. t EPRCo. has estimated that if this minimum case is confirmed or bettered by 25/10-3, platform could he located near 25/11-1 to drain most of the recoverable oil in Fan System 2* and the southern half of Fan System 3*.

Our object would then be to try and prove up another platform location. Shannon and ElnICo. engineers both favor trying to define the northern limit of the sand at,a struc- turally high point. Since we have oil sand in 254;j1-11 we concur that location in the general area north or north- west of 25/8-1 would be more appropriate than trying to define sand limit to the east or south.

By giving you this latest information and how it effects the general rationale of the problem, we hope to be in position to arrive at mutually acceptable loca- tion in the quickest possible manner when the time comes. ' -C) , We presented new minimum case model to EPRCo. using your latest 1 , le, interpretations. The model was constructed using the same princi- ' 0114- plea as the previous one, ie., horizontal 0-W con tact and the sands ' yi.- paralleling the Eocene Rex structure contours. The net sand iso- .'i'll'i . ,4 pachs were constructed using consorvative approach to the environ- L mental interpretation. Copies of the two key net oil sand isopach  soNs t, , .0,',Amodele are included for your information. t EPRCo. has estimated that if this minimum case is confirmed or bettered by 25/10-3, platform could he located near 25/11-1 to drain most of the recoverable oil in Fan System 2* and the southern half of Fan System 3*. We intend to further examine this very im- portant estimation, but as of now, are using it as key point in our considerations for the next stepout location.

By giving you this latest information and how it effects the general rationale of the problem, we hope to be in position to arrive at mutually acceptable loca- tion in the quickest possible manner when the time comes. ' -C) , We presented new minimum case model to EPRCo. using your latest 1 , le, interpretations. The model was constructed using the same princi- ' 0114- plea as the previous one, ie., horizontal 0-W con tact and the sands ' yi.- paralleling the Eocene Rex structure contours. The net sand iso- .'i'll'i . ,4 pachs were constructed using consorvative approach to the environ- L mental interpretation. Copies of the two key net oil sand isopach  soNs t, , .0,',Amodele are included for your information. t EPRCo. has estimated that if this minimum case is confirmed or bettered by 25/10-3, platform could he located near 25/11-1 to drain most of the recoverable oil in Fan System 2* and the southern half of Fan System 3*. We intend to further examine this very im- portant estimation, but as of now, are using it as key point in our considerations for the next stepout location. (CONTINUED..........'et I. 11 '   4tb*S IA. as j We have considored three alternate results from 25/10-3 as follows t- -2 Cl) The well encounters essentially no sand, either oil or water-bearIRTE-the 4ocene. Given thfi result our minimum case wodia be considerably downgraded, both from view- point of oil in place and sand continuity. However, it does not necessarily rule out development. We would look for location in the general vicinity two miles north of 25/11-1, where we would hope to find sufficient sand at structurally high point to increase the confidence factor in our oil in place number, and give us another environ- mental control point. (2) The well runs esaentially as predicted in the minimum. cam). Given this result we feel platform can be diocatod near 25/11-1 using the available data, and that our mini- mum case predictions of structural configuration, sand continuity and horizontal 0-W contact are significantly sup- ported. Our object would then be to try and prove up another platform location. Shannon and ElnICo. engineers both favor trying to define the northern limit of the sand at,a struc- turally high point. Since we have oil sand in 254;j1-11 we concur that location in the general area north or north- west of 25/8-1 would be more appropriate than trying to define sand limit to the east or south. (3) The well encounters no O-W contact or considerably. lower 0-ti than predicted in the mfRITIUm case witif-ihe net nand being 03 tniCk or tgreker than in the MInfinum case. Given Ere result ideally we would like to step further downdip to the northwest from 25/10-3 both to determine the extent of the reservoir and the water drive potential. How- ever, duo to the delicacy of the open acreage situation which we are sure you appreciate, we need to investigate the legal and political ramifications of such location. As an alternative, it may be we should consider the same course of action an for case (2) by trying to prove up another plat- form location to the north and given encouragement, follow it up with an even further downdip well in block 25/0. , We appreciate there are other alternatives for 25/10-3 encompassing such things as different structural result and varying sand per- centages above the 0-W contact. Nevertheless, we feel the above three cases cover the situation sufficiently well at this time to provide an effective rationale of the overall situation. ,e (CONTINUE....))I We will contact you again as soon as we got any additional pertinent information and look forward to receiving your specific recommondations which we appreciate may have to be made by phone immediately 25/10-3 is completed. 4. , ZEE MAYHEW II By .

Jurassic sandstones. The structure is located in the Egersund basin about 135 km south-west of Stavanger, 16 km south-east of the Bream field in block 17/12 (see Pl. 1) and about 115 km north of Ekofisk, which is the nearest oil field in exploitation. The water-depth is 97 m, and the well location is: 04 07' 58 04' The structure is anticlinal, and it is situated in Horst/Graben fault system with number of NE-SW trending faults. Four structures (A, B, and D) can be distinguished in this structural system extending north-west towards Bream (Pl. and 3). However, only the structures and are interesting from resevoir point-of-view. The structure was the one drilled by well 18/10-1 (close to the top of the structure) and proved oil- bearing. The strutural system is overlayed by 350 of Jurassic shales. The reservoir consists of sequence of fine to medium sandstone, shale and coal, and is of deltaic origin.

There seems to be two pressure regimes (see Pl. 4) as the uppermost layer is overpressured with respect to the lower one (from pressure test data). The watertable (WOC) of the upper layer is predicted to be at - 2426 MSL, corresponding to the contact with structure A (spill-point), supposed to be water-bearing due to it being in contact with the water-bearing layer of structure B. The structure (almost 100 % in relinguished area) has not been drilled, but is assumed oil-bearing down to the spill-point (- 2462 MSL). The upper layer (structure B) was tested over interval. The test showed relatively dead oil (low GOR) and small productivity index (4.6 m3/day/bar).

CONSIDERATIONS ON POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT The evaluation of development concept of the 18/10 discovery is governed by three essential parameters: - the amount of recoverable reserves - the well productivity - the expected natural flowing life of the wells The reference to existing marginal fields in production (Argyll, Auk, Buchan), in conjunction with an extrapolation of the Ekofisk early production scheme, shows that the recoverable reserves-treshold for marginaly economical development, by mean of light development scheme, is about Million tons.- - The median (and even the maximum) reserves of the 18/10-1 discovery are far below this limit.

Jurassic sandstones. The structure is located in the Egersund basin about 135 km south-west of Stavanger, 16 km south-east of the Bream field in block 17/12 (see Pl. 1) and about 115 km north of Ekofisk, which is the nearest oil field in exploitation. The water-depth is 97 m, and the well location is: 04 07' 58 04' The structure is anticlinal, and it is situated in Horst/Graben fault system with number of NE-SW trending faults. Four structures (A, B, and D) can be distinguished in this structural system extending north-west towards Bream (Pl. and 3). However, only the structures and are interesting from resevoir point-of-view. The structure was the one drilled by well 18/10-1 (close to the top of the structure) and proved oil- bearing. The strutural system is overlayed by 350 of Jurassic shales. The reservoir consists of sequence of fine to medium sandstone, shale and coal, and is of deltaic origin. The reservoir pressure is close to hydrostatic (gradient 1.083). RESERVOIR CHARACTERISTICS (well 18/10-1) Bottom  . - MSL (2482.3 RKB) WOC  . - MSL (2437.0 in RKB) Gross oil-pay  . Net oil-pay in Average porosity  . % (12 - 30 %) Permeability (from test) . 365 md Average water saturation : % (20 - 45 %) Formation water resistivity: ohms-m at 155F (from logs)- The reservoir is separated in two layers of sandstone parted by thin shale barrier between 2427 and 2433 RKB. There seems to be two pressure regimes (see Pl. 4) as the uppermost layer is overpressured with respect to the lower one (from pressure test data). The watertable (WOC) of the upper layer is predicted to be at - 2426 MSL, corresponding to the contact with structure A (spill-point), supposed to be water-bearing due to it being in contact with the water-bearing layer of structure B. The structure (almost 100 % in relinguished area) has not been drilled, but is assumed oil-bearing down to the spill-point (- 2462 MSL). The upper layer (structure B) was tested over interval. The test showed relatively dead oil (low GOR) and small productivity index (4.6 m3/day/bar). Test results on choke: Oil rate : 295 m3/day (do = glee) Gas-oil ratio : std m3/st m3 Well-head flowing pressure : bars relative Bottom-hole flowing pressure: 193 bars relative Static reservoir pressure : bars relative at - 2400 MSL Formation temperature : 80C OIL ACCUMULATION (see cross section, Pl. 3) The accumulation has been reduced compared to last report (March 1983).

Adequate wellbore integrity will be provided by the 13 3/8 inch casingseatat should this amplitude anomaly be the result of shallow gas deposit. 2. Abnormal Pressure: No abnormal pressure has been encountered in the several offset wells and none is expected in this well. 3. Hole Instability: Gumbo shales can be expected on this well through the Oligocene and down into the top of the Eocene. Bit balling and mud rings have been reported with varing degrees in virtually all wells drilled in the Balder area. The Gumbo has been success- fulle overcome by drilling with seawater and controlling the drilling rate at meters per minute or 27 meters per hour. Attempts to control the gumbo in this area with weighted mud have been unsuccess- ful. Sloughing shales have been reported in the lower part of the Eocene. These shales can usually be controlled with good quality fairly high yield mud. 4.

Abnormal Pressure: No abnormal pressure has been encountered in the several offset wells and none is expected in this well. 3. Hole Instability: Gumbo shales can be expected on this well through the Oligocene and down into the top of the Eocene. Bit balling and mud rings have been reported with varing degrees in virtually all wells drilled in the Balder area. The Gumbo has been success- fulle overcome by drilling with seawater and controlling the drilling rate at meters per minute or 27 meters per hour. Attempts to control the gumbo in this area with weighted mud have been unsuccess- ful. Sloughing shales have been reported in the lower part of the Eocene. These shales can usually be controlled with good quality fairly high yield mud. 4. Lost Circulation: Lost circulation has not occured in offset wells, except as result of gumbo shales packing off the hole. III. Program Summary Program A.

The pit level increase should be gradual since actual kick situations do not normally create sudden large pit level increases. 2. BOP Hang-off Drill This drill will be conducted four times weekly for each tour after surface casing (9-5/8) is set. 3. Power Operated Choke Drill This drill will be conducted prior to drilling out of the surface casing (9-5/8) and (if run). Both tour tool- pushers, drillers, and assistant drillers should operate the choke during this drill. Conduct of the drill and names of those men who operated the choke will be recorded on the daily drilling report. 4. Kick Alarm Drill This drill will be conducted at least once each week. XII. Abnormal Pressure A. Seismic/Offset Prediction Abnormal pressure is not expected in the 25/11-8 well. Seismic data and experience drilling seven offset wells on this block indicate that abnormally pressured formations are not present. However, abnormal pressure detection indicators will be monitored below the 13-3/8 (conductor) casing setting depth. B. Parameters to be Monitored The mud logging unit will record the following parameters re- lating to abnormal pressure: Rate of Penetration Mud Temperature - in/out Mud Flow - in/out Mud Weight - in/out Pit Volume Change in Pit Volume Mud Gas Below the 9-5/8 casing seat manual plots of the following para- meters will also be maintained and reviewed. dc - Exponent Gas Units Howl me Temperature Shale Density C.

Basis for Relief Well Program Experience from offset wells in the Balder area indicates that the most probable blowout zone is the Balder Lobe-9 sand from 1753 to 1791 meters RKB. The maximum possible pressure at the top of this zone is estimated to be sg. The most probable set of circumstances which would result in blowout are: i. The formation fluid is swabbed into the well. The BOP closing system fails. The well goes out of control. This relief well program has been prepared to cope with the worst possible case, i.e. no drill string in the hole and oil flowing at the maximum possible well bore limited rate of 3,240 metric tons per day. The wellbore volume under these conditions is 60.5 m3. The well will be drilled at to 30 meter radius target centered on the blowout wellbore. DRILLING OPERATIONS 1 A.

D. 12-1/4 Hole/9-5/8 Casing (Surface) A 12-1/4 hole will be drilled below the 13-3/8 casing. Direct- ional drilling will start with the kick off point at about 578 m, using an angle build up of approximately 30 per until an angle of about 540 is achieved. This angle will then be main- tained. Directional drilling equipment will be obtained from Stavanger. If part of the drill string has been left in the wild well, Ulsel log will be obtained from the USA and used to aid in di- llrectional drilling. The 12-1/4 hole will be drilled to about TVD, equivalent to about MD. string of 9-5/8 casing will be set and cemented at about 1685 TVD, or about MD. le E. 8-1/2 Hole An 8-1/2 hole will be drilled into the Lobe-9 sand to about 1743 TVD equivalent to about MD. WELL KILLING OPERATIONS All equipment will be positioned and ready for use prior to actually reaching TD. Mud will be prepared and all personnel alerted so that the kill operation can start as soon as possible. 1. Injection String Injection will be established and killing completed down the 9-5/8 casing, using 9-5/8 casing string through the marine riser. The casing will be swaged to drill pipe through the BOP stack and the pipe rams closed on the drill pipe. B142. Initial Injection An initial attempt to fracture the formation will be made using seawater. This will also provide test of the surface equipment. Approximately 875 m3 of seawater will be pumped at m3/min into the wellbore with surface pressure of 77-84 kg/cm2. The seawater will be followed immediately by kill mud. 3. Kill Mud Injection The well will be killed by pumping 300 m3 of sg mud at m3/min and with surface pressure of 35-40 kg/cm2 after the mud reaches TD. mi of mud will be injected into the relief well, m3 will be used to fracture the formation, and m3 will be left in relief well. C. Back-up Procedure If pressure losses between the relief well and the blowing well prove to be excessive, string may be set and perforated to serve as an injection string. The geological section to be drilled is estimated to closely re- semble the prognosis for the original well. It is estimated that mud weights may be maintained according to the original well program to the point where 9-5/8 casing is set. The casing string will be set in approximately sg mud, as compared to the estimated maximum pore pressure of sg. The mud weight may need to be raised prior to drilling out of the 9-5/8 casing, depending on what conditions were encountered in the blowout well. B. Well Killing Operations 1. Mud preparation Three hundred cubic meters of sg mud will be pre- pared for the well killing operation. Preparation will require MT of barite. The mud will be mixed with emphasis on minimum solids content and associated plastic viscosity. 2. Mud Storage Extra tankage will be brought aboard to supplement the approximately 200 m3 storage available on the drilling vessel. Pump Capacity The required pump rates are within the capability of most offshore drilling rigs. However, back-up pumping units are available as shown in appendix A.

Procure Relief Well Drilling Rig This is task which is hard to estimate since it could range from using the rig that was on location to obtaining rig which must P&A it's current well prior to being available. (Time shown here includes possible rig move.) F. Procure Relief Well Materials This will include mud, tubulars, wellheads, and so forth. Since most of the required materials are available at Esso's warehouse, procurement will be minor problem. worst case would be 10 days. G. Procure Directional Drilling Equipment This equipment is available in Stavanger and should be no trouble. Five days are allowed to airfreight any special tools to Norway. H. Drill Relief Well to Kick-off Point This will be straight hole drilling and should be readily ac- complished once rig is on location. I. Directional Drill Well to Target This requires that the directional drilling equipment be pro- cured and moved to location. Well Program This will begin immediately after the blowout occurs using the contingency relief well program as starting point and modifying it as required by actual conditions. K. Procure Well Kill Materials This involves obtaining, transporting and storing the mud and cement materials required to kill the well. L. Procure Well Kill Equipment This involves obtaining and setting up auxiliary mud pits and pumps required to kill the blowing well. M. Kill the Blowing Well This is actual mud pumping operation. N. Plug and Abandon Killed Well This is assumed to involve recovery of the BOP stack, re-entry and plugging of the well. 0. Standby at Relief Well The relief well rig is assumed tostandby while another rig PM's the killed well. P. Plug and Abandon Relief Well C-16 A24The IADC bit classification is three digit number identifying the for- mation/tooth type, degree of hardness within the basic formation, and additional bit specifics.

After the encouraging results of the 15/5-1 exploratory well concept study of general nature was carried out by the operator. The study was presented for the partners in April 1979. The technical/economical results of this study led the managing committee on November 8th, 1979 to the decision of going further and let the operator do more comparable and comprehensive study. SCOPE As the first consept study to great extend was an inhouse exercise, it was felt that this study should draw heavily on external consultants.

231,DISCOVERY_EVALUATION_REPORT,db015483bd0adb1d450b5422de4cd6b07474ae89,23,"B1.2 Summary B1.2.1 Geological Setting Our interpretation of the regional tectonic framework is unchanged from the earlier report, but there is considerable change in the interpretation of paleogeography and depositional environments. Envisaged, is Middle Jurassic delta plain draping the Triassic basin floor with fluvial deposits: channel sands, overbank alluvial deposits, coal and swamp measures. Seliment sources include the area to the south, and the higher flanks of the graben. Primary drainage was northwards along the graben axis.- - Gradually increasing graben subsidence towards the end of the Middle Jurassic, resulted in shallow marine transgression from the north, the dominant sediment deposited was essentially shale. In the youngest deposits however, and .especially those of the marginal coastal regions, sands were deposited in parallic environment consisting of destructive and constructive prograding sandy deltas, the primary deposits of which were frequently reworked on the advancing shallow marine, near-shore shelf. Intercalated bay, lagoon and back barrier deposits are also partly preserved. During the upper Jurassic (Callovian to Oxfordian), grabenal tectonics matured with uneven and possibly oscillatory subsidence due to accompanying salt movements. This complicated the present day sand distribution by partially eroding the crests of contemporaneous highs in the late Callovian and Oxfordian stages. B1.2.2 Depositional Model The Dagny reservoir is contained in part of locally extensive, fairly uniform sheet marine sandstone, which lay offshore from delta-front complex to the south. The delta front is seen in 15/9-2 where it consists of prograding distributary mouth bars and fans, intercalated with coastal marine sediments. From the delta front northwards, transition of facies is found. Shoreface deposits (15/9-1), pass into prodelta, and eventually marine shales (15/6-5). The sheet sand facies of the Dagny feature are then encountered in 15/6-3, 2, and 15/5-1, but eventually shale out into the offshore marine facies found in 15/5-2. These may be relict sands consisting of reworked coastal deposits of an earlier shoreline/deliya front position. Within this model, it is possible to explain facies variations by prograding deposition or dipwards diachroneity. Several correlations of the shallow marine shelf facies and the shoreface to delta front facies are possible. B1.3 Conclusions The Dagny reservoir formation is clearly related to the equivalent Jurassic reservoirs in 15/6-2, 15/6-3, 15/6-4 and .15/6-5; the relationship with the more southerly Sleipner wells, 15/9-1 and 15/9-2, is less clear. equivalent sheet marine sandstone. In the Greater Sleipner Area, two distinct reservoir fades are defined: a) bioturbated, argillaceous sandstones with good to poor reservoir characteristics and b) non-bioturbated, cross-bedded clean sandstone of good to excellent reservoir characteristics. Within these groups ten sub-fades may be delimited. A third group of non-reservoir facies 'comprise further six sub-types, which include coals, marine and non-marine shales, and siltstones . The shallow marine sheet sandstone in which the Dagny reservoir occurs, comprises sub-facies of both types and 'above, and amounts to consistently fair to good quality reservoir of considerable extent. The Dagny reservoir, however, is limited by both tectonic and stratigraphic controls. Crestal erosion to the south - east of 15/5-1 can be expected to significantly reduce the reservoir. Although there is possibility of some slig4 thickening downflank depending on the extent of crestal erosion, downflank thinning will occur northwards towards the eventual shale-out between 15/5-1 and 15/5-2.Bl. Database The database has been improved by the addition of wells Sampling from cores has been increased for the Robertson Research report, and in addition to further conventional core  descriptions and paleontological studies, samples have been specially prepared for palynofacies analysis in an attempt to give greater certainty to the interpreted environments of deposition. B1.5 Stratigraphy Although no changes are reported in the stratigraphy of the 15/5-1 well from the earlier report, changes in the Sleipner area generally, have influence on the modeling of Dagny. We conclude that the Dagny reservoir deposit is the same age and formation as the deposits in 15/6-2, 15/6-3, 15/6-4 and 15/6-5, but may be younger than 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 and may be lithostratigraphically separate.

Separation of this interval from the underlying Triassic is complicated by the sparsity of forms in the vicinity of the boundary. In most cases, this must be established by other means, but significant unconformity is evidenced by the marked absence of Lower Jurassic beds. The Bathonian age assigned to the uppermost interval is based more on the reliable Callovian dating in the base of the overlying formation, than forms diagnostic of Bathonian age. The interval coincides in most wells with the Sleipner Formation. C) Upper Jurassic, Callovian: Confidence in the dating of this interval has increased since the previous report. The interval is characterised by fairly rich and diverse marine assemblage dominated by terrestrially derived miospores.

Envisaged, is Middle Jurassic delta plain draping the Triassic basin floor with fluvial deposits: channel sands, overbank alluvial deposits, coal and swamp measures. Seliment sources include the area to the south, and the higher flanks of the graben. Primary drainage was northwards along the graben axis.- - Gradually increasing graben subsidence towards the end of the Middle Jurassic, resulted in shallow marine transgression from the north, the dominant sediment deposited was essentially shale. In the youngest deposits however, and .especially those of the marginal coastal regions, sands were deposited in parallic environment consisting of destructive and constructive prograding sandy deltas, the primary deposits of which were frequently reworked on the advancing shallow marine, near-shore shelf. Intercalated bay, lagoon and back barrier deposits are also partly preserved. During the upper Jurassic (Callovian to Oxfordian), grabenal tectonics matured with uneven and possibly oscillatory subsidence due to accompanying salt movements. This complicated the present day sand distribution by partially eroding the crests of contemporaneous highs in the late Callovian and Oxfordian stages. B1.2.2 Depositional Model The Dagny reservoir is contained in part of locally extensive, fairly uniform sheet marine sandstone, which lay offshore from delta-front complex to the south. The delta front is seen in 15/9-2 where it consists of prograding distributary mouth bars and fans, intercalated with coastal marine sediments. From the delta front northwards, transition of facies is found. Shoreface deposits (15/9-1), pass into prodelta, and eventually marine shales (15/6-5). The sheet sand facies of the Dagny feature are then encountered in 15/6-3, 2, and 15/5-1, but eventually shale out into the offshore marine facies found in 15/5-2. These may be relict sands consisting of reworked coastal deposits of an earlier shoreline/deliya front position. Within this model, it is possible to explain facies variations by prograding deposition or dipwards diachroneity. Several correlations of the shallow marine shelf facies and the shoreface to delta front facies are possible. B1.3 Conclusions The Dagny reservoir formation is clearly related to the equivalent Jurassic reservoirs in 15/6-2, 15/6-3, 15/6-4 and .15/6-5; the relationship with the more southerly Sleipner wells, 15/9-1 and 15/9-2, is less clear. equivalent sheet marine sandstone. In the Greater Sleipner Area, two distinct reservoir fades are defined: a) bioturbated, argillaceous sandstones with good to poor reservoir characteristics and b) non-bioturbated, cross-bedded clean sandstone of good to excellent reservoir characteristics. Within these groups ten sub-fades may be delimited. A third group of non-reservoir facies 'comprise further six sub-types, which include coals, marine and non-marine shales, and siltstones . The shallow marine sheet sandstone in which the Dagny reservoir occurs, comprises sub-facies of both types and 'above, and amounts to consistently fair to good quality reservoir of considerable extent. The Dagny reservoir, however, is limited by both tectonic and stratigraphic controls. Crestal erosion to the south - east of 15/5-1 can be expected to significantly reduce the reservoir. Although there is possibility of some slig4 thickening downflank depending on the extent of crestal erosion, downflank thinning will occur northwards towards the eventual shale-out between 15/5-1 and 15/5-2.Bl. Database The database has been improved by the addition of wells Sampling from cores has been increased for the Robertson Research report, and in addition to further conventional core  descriptions and paleontological studies, samples have been specially prepared for palynofacies analysis in an attempt to give greater certainty to the interpreted environments of deposition. B1.5 Stratigraphy Although no changes are reported in the stratigraphy of the 15/5-1 well from the earlier report, changes in the Sleipner area generally, have influence on the modeling of Dagny. We conclude that the Dagny reservoir deposit is the same age and formation as the deposits in 15/6-2, 15/6-3, 15/6-4 and 15/6-5, but may be younger than 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 and may be lithostratigraphically separate.

Separation of this interval from the underlying Triassic is complicated by the sparsity of forms in the vicinity of the boundary. In most cases, this must be established by other means, but significant unconformity is evidenced by the marked absence of Lower Jurassic beds. The Bathonian age assigned to the uppermost interval is based more on the reliable Callovian dating in the base of the overlying formation, than forms diagnostic of Bathonian age.

Database The database has been improved by the addition of wells Sampling from cores has been increased for the Robertson Research report, and in addition to further conventional core  descriptions and paleontological studies, samples have been specially prepared for palynofacies analysis in an attempt to give greater certainty to the interpreted environments of deposition. B1.5 Stratigraphy Although no changes are reported in the stratigraphy of the 15/5-1 well from the earlier report, changes in the Sleipner area generally, have influence on the modeling of Dagny. We conclude that the Dagny reservoir deposit is the same age and formation as the deposits in 15/6-2, 15/6-3, 15/6-4 and 15/6-5, but may be younger than 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 and may be lithostratigraphically separate. The following updated bio-stratigraphic scheme is based upon recommendations by Robertson Research, and changes to the lithostratigraphy reflects Norsk Hydres view of the depostional history of the area. Fig. Bl summarises progressive changes during the past years, and Table Bl presents the stratigraphic tops and thicknesses according to the three operators and Robertson Research at this time. B1.5.1. Biostratigraphy a) Triassic: An earlier commitment to naming this interval was avoided in the absence of adequate paleodata, an the possibility existed of misidentifying earlier Jurassic beds of the Fladen Group. Although no significant additions to the paleontological data can be reported, further regional studies and refinement of the regional depositional model add support to Triassic age.b) Middle Jurassic, Bathonian-Bajocian: Although age .diagbostic palynomorphs are rare in this interval. Norsk Hydro in assigning the Bajocian age has high confidence due to the general nature' of the assemblage. This is dominted by abundant non-marine, miospores, which are regionally typical of Bajocian, although brief marine interval is found in 15/5-2, whose age is confirmed by Bajoican marine dinocyst. Separation of this interval from the underlying Triassic is complicated by the sparsity of forms in the vicinity of the boundary. In most cases, this must be established by other means, but significant unconformity is evidenced by the marked absence of Lower Jurassic beds. The Bathonian age assigned to the uppermost interval is based more on the reliable Callovian dating in the base of the overlying formation, than forms diagnostic of Bathonian age. The interval coincides in most wells with the Sleipner Formation. C) Upper Jurassic, Callovian: Confidence in the dating of this interval has increased since the previous report. The interval is characterised by fairly rich and diverse marine assemblage dominated by terrestrially derived miospores. The early Callovian is particularly enriched compared to the middle-late Callovian, and it is becoming easier to distinguish this as formal sub-division, particularly as the early Callovian appears to coincide with the lower, cleaner sand cycles in the Brent equivalent/Reservoir Formation, and the middle-late Callovian appears to coincide with the increasingly ihaley upper part, grading into the Heather Formation. The exact position of the lower boundary is very clearly evidenced by the sharp break into non-marine forms at the top of the Sleipner.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What kind of deposits were made in wellbore 15/5-1's parallic environment?,Sands were deposited in parallic environment.,"In the parallic environment of wellbore 15/5-1, deposits were mostly made up of sands.",0.9

The interval includes both the Brent equivalent 'Reservoir Formation, and the Heather Formation. d) Oxfordian-Kimmerdgian: Age dating of this interval is sufficiently reliable to enable detailed sub-division. The sequence is fully marine, the asseblages being dominated by either miospores or microplankton, with dinocysts of particular value. It corresponds largely to the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, but includes the uppermost levels of the Heather Formation. More detailed information of the above groups is given in Appendix 6. B1.5.2 Lithostratigraphy a) Triassic Group: Consisting of interbedded sandstones and shales, often with red, brown or green tinting; core descriptions clearly identify mud clasts, various styles of cross-bedding, scoured bases and graded beds. No formation name is given at the present by Norsk Hydro, though Statoil introduce Skagerrak Formation after Deegan and Scull. b) Sleipner Formation: This consists of coal seams, rooted seat earths, slumped silts and fine sandstones with pebble bands. In the earlier report it was correlated with the Ness Member (Deegan & Scull) of the Brent Formation. The interval is at least partially cored in most of the wells and is distinct on E-logs; however, the lower contact with the Triassic Group is not always clear, and in certain wells is confined to zone on the sonic and FDC-CNL logs. Occasionally the unconformity may be seen on dipmeter logs. The upper contact with the overlying reservoir formation is cored and easily _recognisable; it is considered to be disconformity. Brent Equivalent/Reservoir Sand Formation: fuller description of the lithology and distribution of the reservoir sands is given in the following sections on sedimentology and depositional modeling, but in general, uniform interval of clean sandstones, of broadly similar thickness. In 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 the formation is notably thicker, and in the former, includes high amounts of intercalated shales particularly in the upper part. In 15/9-2, the thick interval is mostly sand, but of markedly different character to the more northerly wells. These variations have led to the working hypothesis, that the 15/9-1 and 9-2 sands are genetically separate and possibly younger than the others to the north, and the proposal that the upper parts at least are time equivalent to the overlying Heather Formation. Improved paleodating particulary of the 15/9-2 sands, supports this hypothesis, and amendments to the stratigraphic nomenclature from the older report are based in part upon this new depositional interpretation. d) Heather Formation: This consist of carbonaceous silty shales with thin intercalated argillaceous and dolomitic limestones. In the northern part of the area: 15/5-1, 15/6-4, 15/6-2, 15/6-3 and 15/6-5, the break from the underlying reservoir formation is rapid, with sharp break on most of the logs. In the south however, it appears to be the lateral equivalent of the upper part of the reservoir formation, with an intercalated transition zone between 15/6-5 and 15/9-1. The thickness of Heather Formation north of 15/9-1 varies markedly, depending on closeness to the main highs. Where maximum uplift and crestal thinning has occurred, it is largely the Heather which is missing (15/5-1, 15/6-4 and 15/6-3)..8 - The name is consistent with that of Deegan & Scull. Kimmeridge Clay Formation: This interval consists of dark grey, brown or black, organic rich shales, the type being well known in the North Sea as the chief source rock for the Jurassic, and possibly younger reservoirs. B1.6 Sedimentology The sedimentological interpretation of the Heather and Sleipner Formations remains unchanged from the earlier report: that is, that the Heather Formation is quiet water, marine shale, and that the Sleipner Formation represents non-marine delta plain. This agrees with the Robertson Research interpretation which accompanies this report (Appendix 6) In this section therefore, we confine ourselves to the reservoir formation. Robertson Research and Norsk Hydro, have each adopted different approach to the description of sedimentary facies. Having described each of the wells, Robertson Research have found that broadly similar lithologic facies occur in three seperate groups which coincide with tripartite grouping of the wells. This division then forms the basis of their depostional model. full description of these groups is given in Appendix 6; however, they can be summarised as follows: Group 1: 15/5-2 - The Callovian reservoir sands are entirely absent in this well; the time correlative interval being represented by continuous succession of quiet water, open marine shales. lithology of these wells is fairly consistent, compacted column of mainly very fine grained, argillaceous, micaceous and carbonaceous sands. These are locally pebbly, and characterised by cross bedding, ripples, scoured bases, bioturbation and burrowing. Fairly abandant macro and micro fauna confirm marine environment of deposition. In their opinion, the lack of significant shale intercallations highlight the long term continuity of depositional currents, the uniformity of the sand indicating variations to be gradual. This is interpreted as evidence of long term shelf currents below wave base, since the more variable, higher energy deposition above wave base, would be unlikely to produce such significant accumulations. In such an environment, storm surge, and sand wave deposits might be expected, as would lateral transitions into marine shales in any direction. Group 3: 15/9-1.

251,DISCOVERY_EVALUATION_REPORT,db015483bd0adb1d450b5422de4cd6b07474ae89,25,"Interbedded shales, claystones, siltstones and sandstones have both sharp and gradational contacts, and wide variety of bedforms are noted. Most of the interval is burrowed or bioturbated to some degree, with marine conditions determined paleontologically. From these observations and the abundance of transitional prograding sandy units with sharply terminated upper contacts, it can be concluded that the range of depositional energies was significantly greater than in the former two groups and of more inconsistent duration. Robertson Research interpret these factors to indicate shallow marine environment above wave base, where the interplay of wave and tidal currents would produce complex facies variations. In addition, in shallow water conditions minor fluctuations in sea level would have more significant impact on depositional patterns than in the deeper environments envisaged for Groups & 2. In contrast to this interpretive approach, Norsk Hydro'sfmore recent work ,has employed the term facies in more descriptive sense. The original facies groups described in the first report were abandoned in favour of three groups, which, it is hoped, will be of grater assistence not only in more accurate rock description, but also in reservoir simulation. Figs. B2, 3, and describe these groups; they may be summarised as follows:- 10 -  Fades Group 1: Bioturbated, low energy sandstones and sandy or 8ilty-mudstones. The group comprises four sub-facies ranging from fairly clean, finely burrowed sands, to intensely bioturbated siltstones and silty mudstones. These facies may occur in number of depositional environments ranging from fresh water contaminated coastal bays or lagoons, throught the shoreface, to the marine continental shelf. As such they are ambiguous, but in the Sleipner area, particularly 15/9-1 where they are most prevalent, they are considered to represent a transitional area stretching from the lower shoreface to the offshore shelf. Since wave activity would obliterate burrows and restrict burrowing organisms, the high amount of burrowing and bioturbation is interpreted as indicative of low energy area below normal wave base. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of short cycles is taken to indicate either periodic storms and/or the migration of sand waves with intervening muddy troughs. This facies has moderate to poor reservoir quality resulting from the high amounts of primary argillaceous material, and is readily identifiable on E-logs by the bell and funnel gamma log motifs. (Fig. B5). In addition to comprising most of the 15/9-1 interval, sub-facies Ia and occur in close relation to Group II facies in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3 and 15/6-5, but the association is very different to 15/9-1. Group facies is almost entirely absent from 15/9-2. Facies Group II: This comprises clean, non-bioturbated, moderate to high energy ripple and cross-bedded sandstones and pebble beds consisting of six sub-facies. These range from the coarsest pebble/conglomerates with high-angle cross-bedding and rip-up clasts, to the finest, well sorted plane and low angle cross-bedded/laminated sands. The variety of depositional environments of the six sub-facies is considerable, but in Sleipner this is confined to deltaic distributary channels, delta front fans, coastal shoal sands in either estuarine or bay areas, and sand waves or ripples inS. the shoreface, and shallow marine sheets. The lack of argillaceous material, burrowing or bioturbation, is taken to be evidence of sustained high energy deposition generated by currents and/or waves, depending on the location. 'The group is largely absent in 15/9-1, which appears to divide the area into north and south provinces. North of 15/9-1 Group II facies occurs in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3 and 15/6-5, as mainly fine grained deposits with low to moderate angle current cross bedding, with some ripples, and evidence of occasional multidirectional current or wave energy. South of 15/9-1 in 15/9:2, Group II facies are notably coarser, with thick lenses of high angle, unidirectional cross bedded sands, separated by thin intercalations of finer, more moderately cross bedded, sands with multidirectional and ripple cross beds. The southern area is 'interpreted as sequence of rapidly influxed delta front fans deposited in shallow marine/coastal environment. The deposits north of 15/9-1 are interpreted as reworked shallow marine sheet, possibly shoreface sands resulting from an interplay of wave and current activity. An earlier shoreline in this position may have been the source of much of these sands. The Facies Group II sands form the best reservoir rocks due to their low primary argillaceous content. Diagenesis has created only minimal amounts of kaolinite matrix and in general the reservoir quality is good to excellent. Thin ankerite beds may act as vertical permeability barriers. These facies are readily detected on E-logs by smooth, cylinderical gamma motifs. Facies Group III: This group comprises all of the non- bioturbated, non-reservoir shales, mudstones, coals and silty mudstones. They vary in depositional environment from offshore marine shales, to back barrier swamps, interdistributary bay fill and overbank deposits.- 12 - Although thin but significant intercalations of these facies occur in the reservoir intervals, they normally characterise the over and underlying Heather and Sleipner Formations. Fig. B6 is sketch map which shows the occurrence of these facies in four zones. It is apparent that these coincide roughly with the three Robertson Research zones. B1.7.1 Depositional Models From the preceeding section it is apparent that both Norsk Hydro and Robertson Research have broadly similar interpretations of sedimentology and depositional environments, particularly of the Dagny. However, the differences which exist, plus the various possible well correlations, leads to number of different model possibilities. In particular, several interpretations are possible when: correlating the Dagny - 15/6 sheet sands with the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 sands correlating the biostratigrqphic uncertainties of age of these sands relating the Heather Shales to the reservoir sands, when in Dagny the Heather is very thin, yet in 15/6-5 it is very thick, and appears to be time equivalent of the sands in 15/9-1. Furthermore, within the reservoir interval, correlative horizons are rare. In the earlier report, it was suggested that the tight ankerite horizon in the lower part of thef reservoir (particularly prominent in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3, and 15/6-5) be used as correlative datum. However, the now  generally accepted view that this is diagenetic feature leads us to doubt the justification of this. More recent attempts to correlate the various coal seams also appears to be hazardous in view of the palynofacies analysis which seemingly confirms drifted origin for all the coals above the Sleipner Formation.- 13 - From this it is apparent that correlating the reservoir depends largely on interpretation of facies relationships. Three models are presented, based on the following assumptions: That the underlying Sleipner Formation comprises in-situ delta deposits, the top of which is disconformity, and time synchronous datum. That the overlying Reservoir and Heather Formations were deposited in marine environment, resulting from southwards transgression along the Viking graben at the end of the Middle Jurassic.

Most of the interval is burrowed or bioturbated to some degree, with marine conditions determined paleontologically. From these observations and the abundance of transitional prograding sandy units with sharply terminated upper contacts, it can be concluded that the range of depositional energies was significantly greater than in the former two groups and of more inconsistent duration. Robertson Research interpret these factors to indicate shallow marine environment above wave base, where the interplay of wave and tidal currents would produce complex facies variations. In addition, in shallow water conditions minor fluctuations in sea level would have more significant impact on depositional patterns than in the deeper environments envisaged for Groups & 2.

As such they are ambiguous, but in the Sleipner area, particularly 15/9-1 where they are most prevalent, they are considered to represent a transitional area stretching from the lower shoreface to the offshore shelf. Since wave activity would obliterate burrows and restrict burrowing organisms, the high amount of burrowing and bioturbation is interpreted as indicative of low energy area below normal wave base. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of short cycles is taken to indicate either periodic storms and/or the migration of sand waves with intervening muddy troughs.

The southern area is 'interpreted as sequence of rapidly influxed delta front fans deposited in shallow marine/coastal environment. The deposits north of 15/9-1 are interpreted as reworked shallow marine sheet, possibly shoreface sands resulting from an interplay of wave and current activity. An earlier shoreline in this position may have been the source of much of these sands. The Facies Group II sands form the best reservoir rocks due to their low primary argillaceous content. Diagenesis has created only minimal amounts of kaolinite matrix and in general the reservoir quality is good to excellent. Thin ankerite beds may act as vertical permeability barriers. These facies are readily detected on E-logs by smooth, cylinderical gamma motifs. Facies Group III: This group comprises all of the non- bioturbated, non-reservoir shales, mudstones, coals and silty mudstones. They vary in depositional environment from offshore marine shales, to back barrier swamps, interdistributary bay fill and overbank deposits.- 12 - Although thin but significant intercalations of these facies occur in the reservoir intervals, they normally characterise the over and underlying Heather and Sleipner Formations.

B1.7.1 Depositional Models From the preceeding section it is apparent that both Norsk Hydro and Robertson Research have broadly similar interpretations of sedimentology and depositional environments, particularly of the Dagny. However, the differences which exist, plus the various possible well correlations, leads to number of different model possibilities. In particular, several interpretations are possible when: correlating the Dagny - 15/6 sheet sands with the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 sands correlating the biostratigrqphic uncertainties of age of these sands relating the Heather Shales to the reservoir sands, when in Dagny the Heather is very thin, yet in 15/6-5 it is very thick, and appears to be time equivalent of the sands in 15/9-1. Furthermore, within the reservoir interval, correlative horizons are rare. In the earlier report, it was suggested that the tight ankerite horizon in the lower part of thef reservoir (particularly prominent in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3, and 15/6-5) be used as correlative datum. However, the now  generally accepted view that this is diagenetic feature leads us to doubt the justification of this. More recent attempts to correlate the various coal seams also appears to be hazardous in view of the palynofacies analysis which seemingly confirms drifted origin for all the coals above the Sleipner Formation.- 13 - From this it is apparent that correlating the reservoir depends largely on interpretation of facies relationships. Three models are presented, based on the following assumptions: That the underlying Sleipner Formation comprises in-situ delta deposits, the top of which is disconformity, and time synchronous datum. That the overlying Reservoir and Heather Formations were deposited in marine environment, resulting from southwards transgression along the Viking graben at the end of the Middle Jurassic.

Most of the interval is burrowed or bioturbated to some degree, with marine conditions determined paleontologically. From these observations and the abundance of transitional prograding sandy units with sharply terminated upper contacts, it can be concluded that the range of depositional energies was significantly greater than in the former two groups and of more inconsistent duration. Robertson Research interpret these factors to indicate shallow marine environment above wave base, where the interplay of wave and tidal currents would produce complex facies variations. In addition, in shallow water conditions minor fluctuations in sea level would have more significant impact on depositional patterns than in the deeper environments envisaged for Groups & 2.

Figs. B2, 3, and describe these groups; they may be summarised as follows:- 10 -  Fades Group 1: Bioturbated, low energy sandstones and sandy or 8ilty-mudstones. The group comprises four sub-facies ranging from fairly clean, finely burrowed sands, to intensely bioturbated siltstones and silty mudstones. These facies may occur in number of depositional environments ranging from fresh water contaminated coastal bays or lagoons, throught the shoreface, to the marine continental shelf. As such they are ambiguous, but in the Sleipner area, particularly 15/9-1 where they are most prevalent, they are considered to represent a transitional area stretching from the lower shoreface to the offshore shelf. Since wave activity would obliterate burrows and restrict burrowing organisms, the high amount of burrowing and bioturbation is interpreted as indicative of low energy area below normal wave base. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of short cycles is taken to indicate either periodic storms and/or the migration of sand waves with intervening muddy troughs. This facies has moderate to poor reservoir quality resulting from the high amounts of primary argillaceous material, and is readily identifiable on E-logs by the bell and funnel gamma log motifs. (Fig. B5). In addition to comprising most of the 15/9-1 interval, sub-facies Ia and occur in close relation to Group II facies in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3 and 15/6-5, but the association is very different to 15/9-1. Group facies is almost entirely absent from 15/9-2. Facies Group II: This comprises clean, non-bioturbated, moderate to high energy ripple and cross-bedded sandstones and pebble beds consisting of six sub-facies. These range from the coarsest pebble/conglomerates with high-angle cross-bedding and rip-up clasts, to the finest, well sorted plane and low angle cross-bedded/laminated sands. The variety of depositional environments of the six sub-facies is considerable, but in Sleipner this is confined to deltaic distributary channels, delta front fans, coastal shoal sands in either estuarine or bay areas, and sand waves or ripples inS. the shoreface, and shallow marine sheets.

In the earlier report, it was suggested that the tight ankerite horizon in the lower part of thef reservoir (particularly prominent in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3, and 15/6-5) be used as correlative datum. However, the now  generally accepted view that this is diagenetic feature leads us to doubt the justification of this. More recent attempts to correlate the various coal seams also appears to be hazardous in view of the palynofacies analysis which seemingly confirms drifted origin for all the coals above the Sleipner Formation.- 13 - From this it is apparent that correlating the reservoir depends largely on interpretation of facies relationships. Three models are presented, based on the following assumptions: That the underlying Sleipner Formation comprises in-situ delta deposits, the top of which is disconformity, and time synchronous datum. That the overlying Reservoir and Heather Formations were deposited in marine environment, resulting from southwards transgression along the Viking graben at the end of the Middle Jurassic. Model I: This is the model proposed by Robertson Research (Fig. 88) which defines three time equivalent zones of different depositional environment: 1. distal open marine shale facies in the North.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,In what environments does Facies Group I occur in Wellbore 15/5-1?,"These facies may occur in number of depositional environments ranging from fresh water contaminated coastal bays or lagoons, throught the shoreface, to the marine continental shelf. ","Facies Group I can occur in a number of different depositional environments in Wellbore 15/5-1, including freshwater-contaminated coastal bays or lagoons, the shoreface, and the marine continental shelf.",1
260,DISCOVERY_EVALUATION_REPORT,db015483bd0adb1d450b5422de4cd6b07474ae89,25,"Interbedded shales, claystones, siltstones and sandstones have both sharp and gradational contacts, and wide variety of bedforms are noted. Most of the interval is burrowed or bioturbated to some degree, with marine conditions determined paleontologically. From these observations and the abundance of transitional prograding sandy units with sharply terminated upper contacts, it can be concluded that the range of depositional energies was significantly greater than in the former two groups and of more inconsistent duration. Robertson Research interpret these factors to indicate shallow marine environment above wave base, where the interplay of wave and tidal currents would produce complex facies variations. In addition, in shallow water conditions minor fluctuations in sea level would have more significant impact on depositional patterns than in the deeper environments envisaged for Groups & 2. In contrast to this interpretive approach, Norsk Hydro'sfmore recent work ,has employed the term facies in more descriptive sense. The original facies groups described in the first report were abandoned in favour of three groups, which, it is hoped, will be of grater assistence not only in more accurate rock description, but also in reservoir simulation. Figs. B2, 3, and describe these groups; they may be summarised as follows:- 10 -  Fades Group 1: Bioturbated, low energy sandstones and sandy or 8ilty-mudstones. The group comprises four sub-facies ranging from fairly clean, finely burrowed sands, to intensely bioturbated siltstones and silty mudstones. These facies may occur in number of depositional environments ranging from fresh water contaminated coastal bays or lagoons, throught the shoreface, to the marine continental shelf. As such they are ambiguous, but in the Sleipner area, particularly 15/9-1 where they are most prevalent, they are considered to represent a transitional area stretching from the lower shoreface to the offshore shelf. Since wave activity would obliterate burrows and restrict burrowing organisms, the high amount of burrowing and bioturbation is interpreted as indicative of low energy area below normal wave base. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of short cycles is taken to indicate either periodic storms and/or the migration of sand waves with intervening muddy troughs. This facies has moderate to poor reservoir quality resulting from the high amounts of primary argillaceous material, and is readily identifiable on E-logs by the bell and funnel gamma log motifs. (Fig. B5). In addition to comprising most of the 15/9-1 interval, sub-facies Ia and occur in close relation to Group II facies in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3 and 15/6-5, but the association is very different to 15/9-1. Group facies is almost entirely absent from 15/9-2. Facies Group II: This comprises clean, non-bioturbated, moderate to high energy ripple and cross-bedded sandstones and pebble beds consisting of six sub-facies. These range from the coarsest pebble/conglomerates with high-angle cross-bedding and rip-up clasts, to the finest, well sorted plane and low angle cross-bedded/laminated sands. The variety of depositional environments of the six sub-facies is considerable, but in Sleipner this is confined to deltaic distributary channels, delta front fans, coastal shoal sands in either estuarine or bay areas, and sand waves or ripples inS. the shoreface, and shallow marine sheets. The lack of argillaceous material, burrowing or bioturbation, is taken to be evidence of sustained high energy deposition generated by currents and/or waves, depending on the location. 'The group is largely absent in 15/9-1, which appears to divide the area into north and south provinces. North of 15/9-1 Group II facies occurs in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3 and 15/6-5, as mainly fine grained deposits with low to moderate angle current cross bedding, with some ripples, and evidence of occasional multidirectional current or wave energy. South of 15/9-1 in 15/9:2, Group II facies are notably coarser, with thick lenses of high angle, unidirectional cross bedded sands, separated by thin intercalations of finer, more moderately cross bedded, sands with multidirectional and ripple cross beds. The southern area is 'interpreted as sequence of rapidly influxed delta front fans deposited in shallow marine/coastal environment. The deposits north of 15/9-1 are interpreted as reworked shallow marine sheet, possibly shoreface sands resulting from an interplay of wave and current activity. An earlier shoreline in this position may have been the source of much of these sands. The Facies Group II sands form the best reservoir rocks due to their low primary argillaceous content. Diagenesis has created only minimal amounts of kaolinite matrix and in general the reservoir quality is good to excellent. Thin ankerite beds may act as vertical permeability barriers. These facies are readily detected on E-logs by smooth, cylinderical gamma motifs. Facies Group III: This group comprises all of the non- bioturbated, non-reservoir shales, mudstones, coals and silty mudstones. They vary in depositional environment from offshore marine shales, to back barrier swamps, interdistributary bay fill and overbank deposits.- 12 - Although thin but significant intercalations of these facies occur in the reservoir intervals, they normally characterise the over and underlying Heather and Sleipner Formations. Fig. B6 is sketch map which shows the occurrence of these facies in four zones. It is apparent that these coincide roughly with the three Robertson Research zones. B1.7.1 Depositional Models From the preceeding section it is apparent that both Norsk Hydro and Robertson Research have broadly similar interpretations of sedimentology and depositional environments, particularly of the Dagny. However, the differences which exist, plus the various possible well correlations, leads to number of different model possibilities. In particular, several interpretations are possible when: correlating the Dagny - 15/6 sheet sands with the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 sands correlating the biostratigrqphic uncertainties of age of these sands relating the Heather Shales to the reservoir sands, when in Dagny the Heather is very thin, yet in 15/6-5 it is very thick, and appears to be time equivalent of the sands in 15/9-1. Furthermore, within the reservoir interval, correlative horizons are rare. In the earlier report, it was suggested that the tight ankerite horizon in the lower part of thef reservoir (particularly prominent in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3, and 15/6-5) be used as correlative datum. However, the now  generally accepted view that this is diagenetic feature leads us to doubt the justification of this.

Finer details are given in Appendix 6. Model II: This model (Fig. B9) was designed by Norsk Hydro in early 1980 as an attempt to explain some of the facies relationships between the Dagny - 15/6 sheet sand and the shoreface-delta front deposits seen in 15/9-1 and 15/9-2.- 14 - From sedimentological, paleontological, and log correlation studies, the Dagny deposit was established to be related to the 15/6 sands, but considerable differences existed between these and the significantly thicker deposits to the south. It was felt that the uniformity of the Dagny - 15/6 sands would be less likely to give new information than detailed study of 15/9-1 and 15/9-2, where superficial observations showed some interesting depositional patterns. Consequently, Model II evolved out of detailed investigation of these two wells (159-1 and 15/9-2). The prograding vertical sequences seen on logs and in the cores of 15/9-1, were equated to shallowing/deepening sequences of facies in 15/9-2 in an attempt to define cycles of deposition; the following three cycles emerge: Cycle III: An extensive lense-like sheet of intermixed shallow marine, shoreface deposits stretching from north of 15/5-1 to 15/9-2 in the south. In the north these sands shale out into deeper marine shales whereas in the south they thin between over and underlying coal seams, indicating closeness to shoreline. This represents the earliest phase of sand deposition resulting from an initial marine transgressive push southwards. The cycle consists primarly of Facies Group II sands (as defined by Norsk Hydro), with intercalated horizons of Facies Group I. The thickness of sand in the central area (15/6-3 - 15/5-1) may result from sustained reworking of coastal deposits and small shifts in transgressive-regressive shorelines. Cycle III sands comprise all of the reservoir formation deposition in 15/5-2 is deep water marine shale. Dagny may thus be described as Cycle III reservoir.- 15 - Cycle II: Sands of cycle II are found only in 15/9-1 and 15/9-2. Time equivalent deposits are represented in 15/6-5 and possibly 15/6-3 and 15/6-2, by Heather Shales. This pattern was initiated by rise in sea level which pushed the shoreline further south than during Cycle III deposition, submerging Cycle III sands throughout the area. As the centre of sand deposition migrated southwards, corresponding offshore shale was then deposited over the 15/6 area in the form of the Heather Shale Formation. Continuous sand deposition is evidenced in 15/9-2, while 15/9-1 with its -vertical sequence of intercalated sands, silts and silty mudstones, reflects transition zone lying between the north and south areas. In 15/9-2 the sands are dominantly of Facies Group II type and in 15/9-1 they are mainly of Facies Group I. Fig. B7 illustrates the diachronous facies patterns envisioned by Norsk Hydro. In Dagny, these deposits are absent apart from thin veneer of condensed deposits overlyingthe reservoir sand. Assuming that these deposits were originally deposited over this area, then erosion at later date must have occurred over Dagny. Cycle I: Cycle is genetically related to Cycle II, representing further phase of oscillatory transgression and prograding deposition as illustrated in the Figs. B7 and B9. Simularly, this is also confined to the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 wells, and has very similar facies types. Sand deposition in the entire area was brought to close by the submergence of Cycle sands in further transgressive 'push southwards. Heather shale was then deposited over the entire area.- 16 - The absence of Heather Shale over the crestal regions, the Dagny feature in particular, is taken as evidence of active crestal erosion prior to deposition of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, or at least during the early part of Kimmeridge Clay deposition. Accordingly, truncation of the reservoir, could be expected on present day highs or paleohighs where they can be detected seismically. . This model proposes that facies zones lie parallel to the advancing marine front. This is expected to come from the north and consequently the zones lie roughly east to west, although north easterly trend parallel to the graben margin is conceivable. Overlapping of both west-east and north-east shoreline trends are therefore possibility. Fig. B6 illustrates the facies zones, showing diachronous southwards migration of sandy coastal margin facies. Both Models and II clearly demonstrate that the morphology of the Dagny reservoir, is directly related to that of the reservoir in the Sleipner area, particularly that of the 15/6 area. Model III: This model is more of compromise between the two preceding models. It attempts to reconcide the differences in interpretation of environments of deposition, and the differences in timing of sand deposition. These are best explained by the diagram in Fig B8. Any attempts to account for sand distribution in this area are therefore inadequate without structural/tectonic dimension. In general, the structural model outlined in the first report has not been changed. Salt modified grabenal tectonics during the late middle and Upper Jurassic explain the orientation of the Sleipner Terrace and associated flank basins, and fit into an order of events illustrated by thickening/thinning of Callovian/Oxfordian sediments. The sedimentological thinking of Norsk Hydro was confirmed by the Robertson Research report, which contains an excellent summary of the order of events. These results are consistent with the conclusions of the latest Norsk Hydro seismic interpretation of the Jurassic: That no evidence of movements can be found before the end of the deposition of the coal measures. ii conform band of reflectors some 220 thick, overlying the coal sequence in the southern part of the area is observed in flank areas, and interpreted as indicating no significant movement until after deposition of the reservoir (Callovian) sands. iii This conform band of reflectors appears to be truncated in 15/9-2 (50 in of erosion), whereas it is complete in 15/6-5. Correlating this with biostratigraphic information apparently indicates early Oxfordian movement. iv Syndepositional faulting is expected due to the lack of apparent onlap/angular discordances within the seismic data.

As the centre of sand deposition migrated southwards, corresponding offshore shale was then deposited over the 15/6 area in the form of the Heather Shale Formation. Continuous sand deposition is evidenced in 15/9-2, while 15/9-1 with its -vertical sequence of intercalated sands, silts and silty mudstones, reflects transition zone lying between the north and south areas. In 15/9-2 the sands are dominantly of Facies Group II type and in 15/9-1 they are mainly of Facies Group I. Fig. B7 illustrates the diachronous facies patterns envisioned by Norsk Hydro. In Dagny, these deposits are absent apart from thin veneer of condensed deposits overlyingthe reservoir sand. Assuming that these deposits were originally deposited over this area, then erosion at later date must have occurred over Dagny. Cycle I: Cycle is genetically related to Cycle II, representing further phase of oscillatory transgression and prograding deposition as illustrated in the Figs. B7 and B9. Simularly, this is also confined to the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 wells, and has very similar facies types. Sand deposition in the entire area was brought to close by the submergence of Cycle sands in further transgressive 'push southwards. Heather shale was then deposited over the entire area.- 16 - The absence of Heather Shale over the crestal regions, the Dagny feature in particular, is taken as evidence of active crestal erosion prior to deposition of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, or at least during the early part of Kimmeridge Clay deposition. Accordingly, truncation of the reservoir, could be expected on present day highs or paleohighs where they can be detected seismically. . This model proposes that facies zones lie parallel to the advancing marine front. This is expected to come from the north and consequently the zones lie roughly east to west, although north easterly trend parallel to the graben margin is conceivable. Overlapping of both west-east and north-east shoreline trends are therefore possibility. Fig. B6 illustrates the facies zones, showing diachronous southwards migration of sandy coastal margin facies. Both Models and II clearly demonstrate that the morphology of the Dagny reservoir, is directly related to that of the reservoir in the Sleipner area, particularly that of the 15/6 area. Model III: This model is more of compromise between the two preceding models. It attempts to reconcide the differences in interpretation of environments of deposition, and the differences in timing of sand deposition. These are best explained by the diagram in Fig B8. Any attempts to account for sand distribution in this area are therefore inadequate without structural/tectonic dimension. In general, the structural model outlined in the first report has not been changed.

Consequently, Model II evolved out of detailed investigation of these two wells (159-1 and 15/9-2). The prograding vertical sequences seen on logs and in the cores of 15/9-1, were equated to shallowing/deepening sequences of facies in 15/9-2 in an attempt to define cycles of deposition; the following three cycles emerge: Cycle III: An extensive lense-like sheet of intermixed shallow marine, shoreface deposits stretching from north of 15/5-1 to 15/9-2 in the south. In the north these sands shale out into deeper marine shales whereas in the south they thin between over and underlying coal seams, indicating closeness to shoreline.

The cycle consists primarly of Facies Group II sands (as defined by Norsk Hydro), with intercalated horizons of Facies Group I.

This represents the earliest phase of sand deposition resulting from an initial marine transgressive push southwards. The cycle consists primarly of Facies Group II sands (as defined by Norsk Hydro), with intercalated horizons of Facies Group I. The thickness of sand in the central area (15/6-3 - 15/5-1) may result from sustained reworking of coastal deposits and small shifts in transgressive-regressive shorelines. Cycle III sands comprise all of the reservoir formation deposition in 15/5-2 is deep water marine shale. Dagny may thus be described as Cycle III reservoir.- 15 - Cycle II: Sands of cycle II are found only in 15/9-1 and 15/9-2. Time equivalent deposits are represented in 15/6-5 and possibly 15/6-3 and 15/6-2, by Heather Shales. This pattern was initiated by rise in sea level which pushed the shoreline further south than during Cycle III deposition, submerging Cycle III sands throughout the area. As the centre of sand deposition migrated southwards, corresponding offshore shale was then deposited over the 15/6 area in the form of the Heather Shale Formation. Continuous sand deposition is evidenced in 15/9-2, while 15/9-1 with its -vertical sequence of intercalated sands, silts and silty mudstones, reflects transition zone lying between the north and south areas. In 15/9-2 the sands are dominantly of Facies Group II type and in 15/9-1 they are mainly of Facies Group I. Fig. B7 illustrates the diachronous facies patterns envisioned by Norsk Hydro. In Dagny, these deposits are absent apart from thin veneer of condensed deposits overlyingthe reservoir sand. Assuming that these deposits were originally deposited over this area, then erosion at later date must have occurred over Dagny. Cycle I: Cycle is genetically related to Cycle II, representing further phase of oscillatory transgression and prograding deposition as illustrated in the Figs. B7 and B9. Simularly, this is also confined to the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 wells, and has very similar facies types. Sand deposition in the entire area was brought to close by the submergence of Cycle sands in further transgressive 'push southwards. Heather shale was then deposited over the entire area.- 16 - The absence of Heather Shale over the crestal regions, the Dagny feature in particular, is taken as evidence of active crestal erosion prior to deposition of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, or at least during the early part of Kimmeridge Clay deposition. Accordingly, truncation of the reservoir, could be expected on present day highs or paleohighs where they can be detected seismically. . This model proposes that facies zones lie parallel to the advancing marine front. This is expected to come from the north and consequently the zones lie roughly east to west, although north easterly trend parallel to the graben margin is conceivable. Overlapping of both west-east and north-east shoreline trends are therefore possibility. Fig. B6 illustrates the facies zones, showing diachronous southwards migration of sandy coastal margin facies. Both Models and II clearly demonstrate that the morphology of the Dagny reservoir, is directly related to that of the reservoir in the Sleipner area, particularly that of the 15/6 area. Model III: This model is more of compromise between the two preceding models. It attempts to reconcide the differences in interpretation of environments of deposition, and the differences in timing of sand deposition. These are best explained by the diagram in Fig B8. Any attempts to account for sand distribution in this area are therefore inadequate without structural/tectonic dimension. In general, the structural model outlined in the first report has not been changed. Salt modified grabenal tectonics during the late middle and Upper Jurassic explain the orientation of the Sleipner Terrace and associated flank basins, and fit into an order of events illustrated by thickening/thinning of Callovian/Oxfordian sediments. The sedimentological thinking of Norsk Hydro was confirmed by the Robertson Research report, which contains an excellent summary of the order of events. These results are consistent with the conclusions of the latest Norsk Hydro seismic interpretation of the Jurassic: That no evidence of movements can be found before the end of the deposition of the coal measures. ii conform band of reflectors some 220 thick, overlying the coal sequence in the southern part of the area is observed in flank areas, and interpreted as indicating no significant movement until after deposition of the reservoir (Callovian) sands. iii This conform band of reflectors appears to be truncated in 15/9-2 (50 in of erosion), whereas it is complete in 15/6-5. Correlating this with biostratigraphic information apparently indicates early Oxfordian movement. iv Syndepositional faulting is expected due to the lack of apparent onlap/angular discordances within the seismic data.

Finer details are given in Appendix 6. Model II: This model (Fig. B9) was designed by Norsk Hydro in early 1980 as an attempt to explain some of the facies relationships between the Dagny - 15/6 sheet sand and the shoreface-delta front deposits seen in 15/9-1 and 15/9-2.- 14 - From sedimentological, paleontological, and log correlation studies, the Dagny deposit was established to be related to the 15/6 sands, but considerable differences existed between these and the significantly thicker deposits to the south. It was felt that the uniformity of the Dagny - 15/6 sands would be less likely to give new information than detailed study of 15/9-1 and 15/9-2, where superficial observations showed some interesting depositional patterns. Consequently, Model II evolved out of detailed investigation of these two wells (159-1 and 15/9-2). The prograding vertical sequences seen on logs and in the cores of 15/9-1, were equated to shallowing/deepening sequences of facies in 15/9-2 in an attempt to define cycles of deposition; the following three cycles emerge: Cycle III: An extensive lense-like sheet of intermixed shallow marine, shoreface deposits stretching from north of 15/5-1 to 15/9-2 in the south.

Seal comprises Upper Jurassic Heather. Formation shales. Source comprises Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay. The five divisions of the reservoir given in the earlier report are replaced by three-fold division on the basis of the three reservoir cycles outlined in Section VII of this report. The Dagny reservoir is by this model, entirely comprised of Cycle III sands, which are prognosed as sheet marine sandstone of considerable depositional extent. The indications are however, that these are limited to the north of 15/5-1 by shale out as deeper marine conditions are experienced. No further stratigraphic limit is anticipated in the Dagny feature, but the anticipated crestal erosion discussed im the previous section may reduce the reservoir thickness of the higher parts to the southeast, and probably diminish the present calculated reserves. - 19 - B1.9.2 15/5-1 Reservoir relation to 15/5-2: According to each of the models reported above, the reservoir formation encountered in Dagny is expected to shale-out between 15/5-1 and 15/5-2, therefore precluding the 'possibility of any significant continuation northwards. An earlier correlation which suggested that the marine sands found in 15/5-2 (4032.5-4085 m) could be connected to the 15/5-1 sands, is now abandoned due to very good evidence of significant age differences. However, in view of the diachronous southwards migration of marine front interpreted in these models this then indicates the possibility of new reservoir formation in the north in 15/5, consisting of coastal deposits similar to those of the Dagny area, but of an earlier age/stage in the transgression. In similar manner, the control of sand distribution and trapping mechanism would also be combination of stratigraphy and structure. B1.9.3 Fig. B10: This map summarises the results of both Norsk Hydro and Robertson Research as far as reservoir potential is concerned. It defines both the area of probable reservoir diminution by crested erosion, and the stratigraphically defined reservoir zones. These may be summarised as: Zone I: Callovian prospects: Nil due to shale out northwards. Alternative Jurassic objective is Bajocian marine sand which may thicken northwards, but will in similar manner to the Callovian marine sands, eventually shale out, and may have only limited extent.- 20 - Zone II: Callovian prospects good outside of central band of possible crestal erosion. Sands in this zone are  of consistent thickness (50-80 m), and lithologic, and reservoir character. They are defined as clean sheet marine sands, with average porosities of 15-18%. Zone III: Callovian prospects poor to fairly good. 'Although the gross reservoir interval is greater than in Zone II, reservoir quality is diminished by high amounts of intercallated marine shales and transitional silty, argillaceous beds. The zone is considered to represent stratigraphic transition from good sands in the south to poorer sands and shales in the north. Zone IV: Callovian prospects good to excellent due to zone of coastal and delta front deposits. Reservoir quality is good to excellent, with porosities consistently ranging from 18-25% over an interval of some 150 m.C. GEOPHYSICS Since the previous report (Development concept study of the 15/5-1 Deposit, June 1979) there is no additional seismic data. The work done, has been concentrated on trying to tie from the 15/5-1 (the Dagny) structure and southwards into the Sleipner area. At base reservoir level Top Sleipner Formation we have confirmed our previous mapping. Mapping of the top of the Reservoir Sand, however has not been sucessful with the present data base. It has been decided by the Exploration and Management Committees to perform three dimensional seismic survey over the structure. This survey will be shot by Geco during the summer of 1980, and the results are expected towards the end of the year. A stratigraphic interpretation based on the present geological model will be attempted. We do believe however, that the structural picture will not change untill the three dimentional survey enable us to show the detailed pattern of this structure. Until we can oombine this picture with the recently developed geological model the volumetric calculation will remain unchanged from the previous report.11) D.

However, in view of the diachronous southwards migration of marine front interpreted in these models this then indicates the possibility of new reservoir formation in the north in 15/5, consisting of coastal deposits similar to those of the Dagny area, but of an earlier age/stage in the transgression. In similar manner, the control of sand distribution and trapping mechanism would also be combination of stratigraphy and structure. B1.9.3 Fig. B10: This map summarises the results of both Norsk Hydro and Robertson Research as far as reservoir potential is concerned. It defines both the area of probable reservoir diminution by crested erosion, and the stratigraphically defined reservoir zones. These may be summarised as: Zone I: Callovian prospects: Nil due to shale out northwards. Alternative Jurassic objective is Bajocian marine sand which may thicken northwards, but will in similar manner to the Callovian marine sands, eventually shale out, and may have only limited extent.- 20 - Zone II: Callovian prospects good outside of central band of possible crestal erosion. Sands in this zone are  of consistent thickness (50-80 m), and lithologic, and reservoir character. They are defined as clean sheet marine sands, with average porosities of 15-18%. Zone III: Callovian prospects poor to fairly good. 'Although the gross reservoir interval is greater than in Zone II, reservoir quality is diminished by high amounts of intercallated marine shales and transitional silty, argillaceous beds. The zone is considered to represent stratigraphic transition from good sands in the south to poorer sands and shales in the north. Zone IV: Callovian prospects good to excellent due to zone of coastal and delta front deposits. Reservoir quality is good to excellent, with porosities consistently ranging from 18-25% over an interval of some 150 m.C. GEOPHYSICS Since the previous report (Development concept study of the 15/5-1 Deposit, June 1979) there is no additional seismic data. The work done, has been concentrated on trying to tie from the 15/5-1 (the Dagny) structure and southwards into the Sleipner area. At base reservoir level Top Sleipner Formation we have confirmed our previous mapping. Mapping of the top of the Reservoir Sand, however has not been sucessful with the present data base. It has been decided by the Exploration and Management Committees to perform three dimensional seismic survey over the structure. This survey will be shot by Geco during the summer of 1980, and the results are expected towards the end of the year. A stratigraphic interpretation based on the present geological model will be attempted. We do believe however, that the structural picture will not change untill the three dimentional survey enable us to show the detailed pattern of this structure. Until we can oombine this picture with the recently developed geological model the volumetric calculation will remain unchanged from the previous report.11) D.

At base reservoir level Top Sleipner Formation we have confirmed our previous mapping. Mapping of the top of the Reservoir Sand, however has not been sucessful with the present data base. It has been decided by the Exploration and Management Committees to perform three dimensional seismic survey over the structure. This survey will be shot by Geco during the summer of 1980, and the results are expected towards the end of the year. A stratigraphic interpretation based on the present geological model will be attempted. We do believe however, that the structural picture will not change untill the three dimentional survey enable us to show the detailed pattern of this structure. Until we can oombine this picture with the recently developed geological model the volumetric calculation will remain unchanged from the previous report.11) D. RESERVOIR AND BASIC DATA The basic input data for the present study are given in this chapter. Since the Development Concept Study of 15/5-1 Deposit, April 1979, was carried out no vital additional data have been worked out. Only relatively short summary of the above report will therefore be presented below. The 15/5-1 Development Concept Study presents the formation .evaluation and petrophysical data examined from log and laboratory results. The results have been generalised and partly normalised in order to be used further as average parameters. The samples from the DST are considered representative since they were obtained during steady-state flow at separate conditions. They have been analysed in detail through PVT, supplemented with C7+ distillation and retrograde condensation. The results have been further reviewed and prepared for field behaviour evaluation. The PVT study shows that the reservoir hydrocarbons have the characteristics of gas condensate-fluid.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What type of fluid does the reservoir in Wellbore 15/5-1 contain?,The PVT study shows that the reservoir hydrocarbons have the characteristics of gas condensate-fluid.,"The pressure, volume, temperature (PVT) study for Wellbore 15/5-1 reveals that the reservoir hydrocarbons possess the characteristics of gas condensate-fluid.",1

(Fig. B10). It is within this zone t-hat'diminution of the reservoir and/or its seal can be- 18 expected. From the structural model, the present highs may result partly from later salt movement, and consequently the possibility of paleohighs now in downflank location cannot be ignored. Such areas may not be defined until after more ! detailed seismic study has been completed, and this is likely to be postponed until after the 3D survey. B1.9 Reservoirs B1.9.1 Dagny-Sleipner Reservoir: The basic conditions of the reservoir are unchanged from the earlier report: Reservoir comprises Upper Jurassic sands. Seal comprises Upper Jurassic Heather. Formation shales. Source comprises Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay. The five divisions of the reservoir given in the earlier report are replaced by three-fold division on the basis of the three reservoir cycles outlined in Section VII of this report. The Dagny reservoir is by this model, entirely comprised of Cycle III sands, which are prognosed as sheet marine sandstone of considerable depositional extent. The indications are however, that these are limited to the north of 15/5-1 by shale out as deeper marine conditions are experienced. No further stratigraphic limit is anticipated in the Dagny feature, but the anticipated crestal erosion discussed im the previous section may reduce the reservoir thickness of the higher parts to the southeast, and probably diminish the present calculated reserves. - 19 - B1.9.2 15/5-1 Reservoir relation to 15/5-2: According to each of the models reported above, the reservoir formation encountered in Dagny is expected to shale-out between 15/5-1 and 15/5-2, therefore precluding the 'possibility of any significant continuation northwards. An earlier correlation which suggested that the marine sands found in 15/5-2 (4032.5-4085 m) could be connected to the 15/5-1 sands, is now abandoned due to very good evidence of significant age differences. However, in view of the diachronous southwards migration of marine front interpreted in these models this then indicates the possibility of new reservoir formation in the north in 15/5, consisting of coastal deposits similar to those of the Dagny area, but of an earlier age/stage in the transgression. In similar manner, the control of sand distribution and trapping mechanism would also be combination of stratigraphy and structure. B1.9.3 Fig. B10: This map summarises the results of both Norsk Hydro and Robertson Research as far as reservoir potential is concerned. It defines both the area of probable reservoir diminution by crested erosion, and the stratigraphically defined reservoir zones. These may be summarised as: Zone I: Callovian prospects: Nil due to shale out northwards. Alternative Jurassic objective is Bajocian marine sand which may thicken northwards, but will in similar manner to the Callovian marine sands, eventually shale out, and may have only limited extent.- 20 - Zone II: Callovian prospects good outside of central band of possible crestal erosion. Sands in this zone are  of consistent thickness (50-80 m), and lithologic, and reservoir character. They are defined as clean sheet marine sands, with average porosities of 15-18%. Zone III: Callovian prospects poor to fairly good. 'Although the gross reservoir interval is greater than in Zone II, reservoir quality is diminished by high amounts of intercallated marine shales and transitional silty, argillaceous beds. The zone is considered to represent stratigraphic transition from good sands in the south to poorer sands and shales in the north. Zone IV: Callovian prospects good to excellent due to zone of coastal and delta front deposits. Reservoir quality is good to excellent, with porosities consistently ranging from 18-25% over an interval of some 150 m.C.

Cooling of well fluid A wellhead temperature of approx. 85C is foreseen during the initial phase of production. For operational reasons cooling to approx. 40C will be neccessary before the gas enters the glycol dehydration unit. Adiabatic expansion across the choke will lower the well- head temperature in the initial phase, thus reducing the cooler load. Later in the platteau production period re- duced expansion will increase the cooler load somewhat. Separation Separation will be undertaken in single three-phase sepa- ration at 70 bal. The liquid residence time initially will be about minutes which is adequate for vapour/liquid sepa- ration and reasonable for water/oil separation in the first years when water production is small. In later years, the reduced flowing liquid volume will lead to improved separa- tion efficiency if the proportion of water is increasing. The primary separator has been sized for full field flow and a separate test separator has been provided. Water separation will take place in the main separator and discharge will be controlled by an interface controller. A single vessel separator is proposed. Glycol Dehyration Although molecular sieve or low temperature separation could be proposed, there is no requirement in this processing scheme for hydrocarbon dewpoint control. Tr-ethylene gly- col dehydration has been proposed due to its flexibility, ease of operation and accepted status for use on water dew- point control to quite stringent levels. The pressure and temperature levels of 70 bar ( and 40c are common levels and lead to no complication in design. Condensate Treatment Despite the ability of glycol contactor to remove the majority of water from the gas phase, calculations show that recombination of gas and untreated condensate will reintroduce certain amount of free water in the sea- line. The main sources of free water are: Untreated condensate being water saturated. Carry-over from the liquid separation. Water condensing in the sea line due to the temperature drop. Although the condensate could be dehydrated by adsorption onto molecular sieves or by stripping, the large unit re- quired would hardly be justified. The implications of reinjecting untreated condensate into the gas stream seems to be potential danger of corrosion and hydrate formation in the sea line. Various inhibitors must be injected continuously, but even then the combination of free water and the high CO2-content makes the alternative unfavourable.\ In future, more detailed study the technical- and economical feasibility of installing condensate dehyd- ration unit on 15/5 should be examined in detail. At this stage it seems that separate condensate line from 15/5 to Sleipner would be favourable alternative to condensate reinjection. The marginal cost of such line will be counterbalanced by advantages such as:  No CO2 corrosion problem in the gas line. No hydrate formation problem in the gas line. Reduced two phase flow problems in the gas line. More simple processing on the Sleipner multipurpose platform. Product Metering Both product streams before recombination and the produced water will be metered; the gas by orifice plate meters and the condensate and water by positive displacement or turbine meters. removal As the reservoir fluid contains rather high percentage of CO2' CO2 removal unit could be foreseen on the 15/5 plat- form. It is likely, however, that an eventual removal of CO2 will take place on the central platform. The problem of CO2 removal has therefore not been part of this study. Water Treatment The produced water will be passed to two oil/water separa- tion systems and discharged to sea with acceptable quality standards.

E.1.1.3 Alternate Drilling ProposalS Two alternative drilling modes are being considered. One option is to pre-drill the.seven wells from semisubmersible through guidance template. The semi-submersible is then removed and the production platform installed with workover rig on it, which then completes the wells. The second option is the conventional one of erecting the production platform first of all, then drill and complete all seven wells with the same large rig mounted on it. This would probably be retained for subsequent use on workovers. This second alternate is less expensive drilling operation, but takes approximately year longer to bring the wells into production, as will be seen from the following detailed des- cription of the two alternates. a. Pre-drilling from semi-submersible The semi-submersible would be totally self-supporting for the drilling work and would provide accommodation aboard for the ship's crew, the drilling crew, and service personnel. It would include helideck and crane for personnel and mate- rials transfer. The semi-submersible will need tugs for towage in and out, but the other support services required whilst drilling, i.e. helicopters work boats, standby boat, etc., are common to both options. The semi-submersible could commence work at an early date determined by the delivery date for the template and the time required to negotiate suitable contracts and obtain delivery of the semi-submersible itself, and all well consumables. When semi-submersible is used, then the wells have to be left cased and provided with facilities for subsequent tie back of the casing to the wellhead deck of the platform before they can be completed by the workover rig on the platform. This is well established technique employed in shallower water, but not yet proven for North Sea depths. The semi-submersible cannot be brought back to complete the wells after installation of the platform nor for subsequent workovers since platform in North Sea conditions would have to have its deck 100 feet above sea level to be clear of the 'maximum waves. Therefore, platform mounted workover rig is required for these operations. One decision to be made is whether workover rig should be purchased and installed permanently on the platform or whether it would be better to hire complete self-contained workover rig for temporary installation on the platform, firstly for initial completion of the wells, then subsequently for say two, maybe three workover on each of the wells during the life of the field, and finally for plugging off the wells. In the Gulf of nexico, it is the normal procedure, although, not yet in the North Sea, for modularized workover rigs to be made available to operators by contractors for hire. These units can be very compact, and provided that platform includes two 40 ton cranes (at 12 reach) the workover rig packages can beC. transported by work boat and liftet aboard with the platform cranes. If contractor cannot be encouraged to provide rig when required, then an alternative would be to buy such rig. b. Tie-back 02erations This has been common parctice in shallower water using jack-up rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern part of the North Sea; also using semi-submersibles in the Gulf of Mexico and offhore Indonesia. Union Oil in Indonesia used shallow water tie-back sytem designed by Vetco. They and the National Supply Company have also used their tie-back equipment in the Gulf of Mexico. However, no tie-backs have yet been made in deep water in the North Sea, but are being planned by number of operators for 1980/81. Cameron are undertaking to provide prototype tie-back system for 19 wells in the Maureen field in 100 of water, which can accommodate 2 of misalignment. They have another design on paper for up to 5 misalignment. The National Supply Company also has prototype design on paper which is development of their shallow water experience and allows for the well to be 11/2 out of vertical and the plat- form to be 2 off vertical in addition. Vetco have developed deep water tie-back system from the shallow water system they have used in Indonesia and. the Gulf of Mexico and have made presentation concerning it to Norsk Hydro in Norway. Their system seems to be the most advanced design to date and will first be installed on Fulmar in March/April. 1980. They also have made proposals for NW Hutton, S. Montrose, Tiffany, and Maureen fields. The basic problem with tie-back of wells in deep water is toensure that there is minimum of misalignment. First of all, the top 100-150m of the well should be within 10 of vertical, secondly, the platform must be sufficiently closely positioned over the template and vertical, so that the casing from the wellhead on the platform to the seabed tie-back has an overall misalignment with the well bore of less than about 2o, and this should not be aggravated by settlement of the platform, nor by excessive manufacturing tolerances on the jacket or template. Location of the jacket accurately over thea template should not be too difficult using an acoustic reference system and addi- tional control by underwater television and floodlights, so that guide funnels on the jacket are lowered over piles pro- jecting from the template. Piling jacket into the seabed, so that it is vertical, is also'anestablished technique. c.

Vetco have developed deep water tie-back system from the shallow water system they have used in Indonesia and. the Gulf of Mexico and have made presentation concerning it to Norsk Hydro in Norway. Their system seems to be the most advanced design to date and will first be installed on Fulmar in March/April. 1980. They also have made proposals for NW Hutton, S. Montrose, Tiffany, and Maureen fields. The basic problem with tie-back of wells in deep water is toensure that there is minimum of misalignment. First of all, the top 100-150m of the well should be within 10 of vertical, secondly, the platform must be sufficiently closely positioned over the template and vertical, so that the casing from the wellhead on the platform to the seabed tie-back has an overall misalignment with the well bore of less than about 2o, and this should not be aggravated by settlement of the platform, nor by excessive manufacturing tolerances on the jacket or template. Location of the jacket accurately over thea template should not be too difficult using an acoustic reference system and addi- tional control by underwater television and floodlights, so that guide funnels on the jacket are lowered over piles pro- jecting from the template. Piling jacket into the seabed, so that it is vertical, is also'anestablished technique. c.

E.1.1.3 Alternate Drilling ProposalS Two alternative drilling modes are being considered. One option is to pre-drill the.seven wells from semisubmersible through guidance template. The semi-submersible is then removed and the production platform installed with workover rig on it, which then completes the wells. The second option is the conventional one of erecting the production platform first of all, then drill and complete all seven wells with the same large rig mounted on it. This would probably be retained for subsequent use on workovers. This second alternate is less expensive drilling operation, but takes approximately year longer to bring the wells into production, as will be seen from the following detailed des- cription of the two alternates. a. Pre-drilling from semi-submersible The semi-submersible would be totally self-supporting for the drilling work and would provide accommodation aboard for the ship's crew, the drilling crew, and service personnel. It would include helideck and crane for personnel and mate- rials transfer. The semi-submersible will need tugs for towage in and out, but the other support services required whilst drilling, i.e. helicopters work boats, standby boat, etc., are common to both options. The semi-submersible could commence work at an early date determined by the delivery date for the template and the time required to negotiate suitable contracts and obtain delivery of the semi-submersible itself, and all well consumables. When semi-submersible is used, then the wells have to be left cased and provided with facilities for subsequent tie back of the casing to the wellhead deck of the platform before they can be completed by the workover rig on the platform. This is well established technique employed in shallower water, but not yet proven for North Sea depths. The semi-submersible cannot be brought back to complete the wells after installation of the platform nor for subsequent workovers since platform in North Sea conditions would have to have its deck 100 feet above sea level to be clear of the 'maximum waves. Therefore, platform mounted workover rig is required for these operations. One decision to be made is whether workover rig should be purchased and installed permanently on the platform or whether it would be better to hire complete self-contained workover rig for temporary installation on the platform, firstly for initial completion of the wells, then subsequently for say two, maybe three workover on each of the wells during the life of the field, and finally for plugging off the wells. In the Gulf of nexico, it is the normal procedure, although, not yet in the North Sea, for modularized workover rigs to be made available to operators by contractors for hire. These units can be very compact, and provided that platform includes two 40 ton cranes (at 12 reach) the workover rig packages can beC. transported by work boat and liftet aboard with the platform cranes. If contractor cannot be encouraged to provide rig when required, then an alternative would be to buy such rig. b.

They have another design on paper for up to 5 misalignment. The National Supply Company also has prototype design on paper which is development of their shallow water experience and allows for the well to be 11/2 out of vertical and the plat- form to be 2 off vertical in addition. Vetco have developed deep water tie-back system from the shallow water system they have used in Indonesia and. the Gulf of Mexico and have made presentation concerning it to Norsk Hydro in Norway. Their system seems to be the most advanced design to date and will first be installed on Fulmar in March/April. 1980. They also have made proposals for NW Hutton, S. Montrose, Tiffany, and Maureen fields. The basic problem with tie-back of wells in deep water is toensure that there is minimum of misalignment. First of all, the top 100-150m of the well should be within 10 of vertical, secondly, the platform must be sufficiently closely positioned over the template and vertical, so that the casing from the wellhead on the platform to the seabed tie-back has an overall misalignment with the well bore of less than about 2o, and this should not be aggravated by settlement of the platform, nor by excessive manufacturing tolerances on the jacket or template. Location of the jacket accurately over thea template should not be too difficult using an acoustic reference system and addi- tional control by underwater television and floodlights, so that guide funnels on the jacket are lowered over piles pro- jecting from the template. Piling jacket into the seabed, so that it is vertical, is also'anestablished technique. c.

E.1.1.3 Alternate Drilling ProposalS Two alternative drilling modes are being considered. One option is to pre-drill the.seven wells from semisubmersible through guidance template. The semi-submersible is then removed and the production platform installed with workover rig on it, which then completes the wells. The second option is the conventional one of erecting the production platform first of all, then drill and complete all seven wells with the same large rig mounted on it. This would probably be retained for subsequent use on workovers. This second alternate is less expensive drilling operation, but takes approximately year longer to bring the wells into production, as will be seen from the following detailed des- cription of the two alternates. a. Pre-drilling from semi-submersible The semi-submersible would be totally self-supporting for the drilling work and would provide accommodation aboard for the ship's crew, the drilling crew, and service personnel. It would include helideck and crane for personnel and mate- rials transfer. The semi-submersible will need tugs for towage in and out, but the other support services required whilst drilling, i.e. helicopters work boats, standby boat, etc., are common to both options. The semi-submersible could commence work at an early date determined by the delivery date for the template and the time required to negotiate suitable contracts and obtain delivery of the semi-submersible itself, and all well consumables. When semi-submersible is used, then the wells have to be left cased and provided with facilities for subsequent tie back of the casing to the wellhead deck of the platform before they can be completed by the workover rig on the platform. This is well established technique employed in shallower water, but not yet proven for North Sea depths. The semi-submersible cannot be brought back to complete the wells after installation of the platform nor for subsequent workovers since platform in North Sea conditions would have to have its deck 100 feet above sea level to be clear of the 'maximum waves. Therefore, platform mounted workover rig is required for these operations. One decision to be made is whether workover rig should be purchased and installed permanently on the platform or whether it would be better to hire complete self-contained workover rig for temporary installation on the platform, firstly for initial completion of the wells, then subsequently for say two, maybe three workover on each of the wells during the life of the field, and finally for plugging off the wells. In the Gulf of nexico, it is the normal procedure, although, not yet in the North Sea, for modularized workover rigs to be made available to operators by contractors for hire. These units can be very compact, and provided that platform includes two 40 ton cranes (at 12 reach) the workover rig packages can beC. transported by work boat and liftet aboard with the platform cranes. If contractor cannot be encouraged to provide rig when required, then an alternative would be to buy such rig. b.

This option entails heavier rig and considerably more drill- pipe and casing and other consumables on the platform than the workover rig in the pre-drilling scheme. After completion of the wells, it is worth considering whether there is an economic case for removal of this rig and selling it, then bringing on rented workover rig for the brief periods when it is required in the future. This would eliminate the heavy maintenance cost of keeping the original rig out there for workovers during the working life of the platform. How- ever, the platform still has to be designed to be large enough to accommodate the larqe initial drilling rig. It is evident that drilling cannot start until the larger plat- form and jacket have been designed, built, placed, and then all the modlues installed on the deck, using an expensive der- rick barge spred. After initial installation and commissioning of the drilling rig modules and provision of accommodation and services, it will be possible to commence drilling while hook- up continues on the production modlues. d. Miscellaneous The two optional drilling modes would require different levels of storage capacity for fuel, drilling equipment, well consuma- bles, and stores. By pre-drilling, the wells, alle the drilling equipment, well consumables, and stores to support the drilling operation will have been channelled through the semi-submersible operation leaving only the tie-back and drilling out capacity require- ment of the workover rig requiring support. The high level of CO2 will demand strictly controlled practices to deal with corrosion. These will include continuous injection of filming amine inhibitor as well as glycol to prevent the formation of hydrates. . . E Platform Configuration For the purposes of this study, it was decided to adopt con- ventional piled jacket as the basis of.comparison. The design of such structures is well proven, and reliable weight and cost estimates for the structure can be developed with comparative ease. Time and costs of installation of such structures are prone to uncertainties such as weather and the market supply, an demand of offshore support units. Nevertheless, sufficient historical information from North Sea operations is available to realistically quantify the likely range of costs. A piled steel jacket of this sort is probably not the most cost effective fixed structure for this location. Section 1.1.5 deals with the alternatives that exist and from this superficial examination, it is probable that the single leg jack-up concept, with pre-commissioned topside equipment installed over predrilled template would be comparable in cost. a. Influence of Method of Installation Barge launching the structure on location is the conventional method of installation, followed by controlled flooding to up- right the structure and final sinking to the seabed. If such a method is adopted, at least one face of the structure must have two parallel lauch tracks, and strong launch truss must be incorporated internally. This implies that at least legs must be used arranged in two rows of 4. The major disadvantage of such an eight-leg structure is that the wave force attracted are larger than for more open four legged structure . This is only true, however, if provision for installation is not considered and for heavier structures. The conventional North Sea approach has been to build large self-floating legs, which attract considerable extra wave force, (e.g. Thistle, Ninian, Magnus) or fabricate purpose built floa- taion rafts, which can be submerged with the structure atta- ched (e.g. Froties). The Forties system is not now favoured because of the lack of resuability of the floatation rafts and in each case, considerable extra problems of fabrication are introduced. The most complex and time consuming fabrication for self-floating jackets is for the floatation legs on the ground,,and this must be substantially complete before the main jacket structure can be built. This.complicatps and extends the fabrication process. A four legged structure without provision for installation will generally weight less because of the reduced wave forces and more open structure. It is not as redundant as an eight leggedft jacket and fabrication details at nodes are more complex although there are fewer nodes. Generally therefore, where possbile, barge launched jackets appearto be the most approporate. Recently the Murchison field development has extended the proven range .of barge launching, although at this stage the Magnus jacket in 180 of water was considered too large and was designed as self-floating tower. For the structures considered in this study, with light pay- loads, it would seem logical to use barge launched structure. However, it may be possible, with the heavy lifting capacities now available, to consider lifting the structure into position from barge. This is common method of installation else- where in the world, but has not been attempted in the Northern North Sea. The final alternative, which has not been attemped on any major jacket, is to consider side launching of jacket. This final option, whilst potentially attractive, is not considered in this study because it relies on equipment that does not at present exist. b. Structural Weights The weight of the jacket for the full drilling rig and barge launched case Was evaluated from member by member sizing exercise, leading to jacket weight which would be expected to be within 10% of the final design weight. See Fig. E-4. For the launched jacket with workover facilities only, the weight summery is shown in Fig, E-5. The weight of an alternative four legged structure is shown in Fig. E-6.E.1.1.5 Structural Alternatives A range of alternatives to piled steel jackets have been evaluated for the development of the 15/5 marginal field. One may conclude that today there are no clear guidelines as to which type of structures are the most suitable.

This option entails heavier rig and considerably more drill- pipe and casing and other consumables on the platform than the workover rig in the pre-drilling scheme. After completion of the wells, it is worth considering whether there is an economic case for removal of this rig and selling it, then bringing on rented workover rig for the brief periods when it is required in the future. This would eliminate the heavy maintenance cost of keeping the original rig out there for workovers during the working life of the platform. How- ever, the platform still has to be designed to be large enough to accommodate the larqe initial drilling rig. It is evident that drilling cannot start until the larger plat- form and jacket have been designed, built, placed, and then all the modlues installed on the deck, using an expensive der- rick barge spred. After initial installation and commissioning of the drilling rig modules and provision of accommodation and services, it will be possible to commence drilling while hook- up continues on the production modlues. d. Miscellaneous The two optional drilling modes would require different levels of storage capacity for fuel, drilling equipment, well consuma- bles, and stores. By pre-drilling, the wells, alle the drilling equipment, well consumables, and stores to support the drilling operation will have been channelled through the semi-submersible operation leaving only the tie-back and drilling out capacity require- ment of the workover rig requiring support. The high level of CO2 will demand strictly controlled practices to deal with corrosion. These will include continuous injection of filming amine inhibitor as well as glycol to prevent the formation of hydrates. . . E Platform Configuration For the purposes of this study, it was decided to adopt con- ventional piled jacket as the basis of.comparison. The design of such structures is well proven, and reliable weight and cost estimates for the structure can be developed with comparative ease. Time and costs of installation of such structures are prone to uncertainties such as weather and the market supply, an demand of offshore support units. Nevertheless, sufficient historical information from North Sea operations is available to realistically quantify the likely range of costs. A piled steel jacket of this sort is probably not the most cost effective fixed structure for this location. Section 1.1.5 deals with the alternatives that exist and from this superficial examination, it is probable that the single leg jack-up concept, with pre-commissioned topside equipment installed over predrilled template would be comparable in cost. a. Influence of Method of Installation Barge launching the structure on location is the conventional method of installation, followed by controlled flooding to up- right the structure and final sinking to the seabed. If such a method is adopted, at least one face of the structure must have two parallel lauch tracks, and strong launch truss must be incorporated internally. This implies that at least legs must be used arranged in two rows of 4. The major disadvantage of such an eight-leg structure is that the wave force attracted are larger than for more open four legged structure . This is only true, however, if provision for installation is not considered and for heavier structures. The conventional North Sea approach has been to build large self-floating legs, which attract considerable extra wave force, (e.g. Thistle, Ninian, Magnus) or fabricate purpose built floa- taion rafts, which can be submerged with the structure atta- ched (e.g. Froties). The Forties system is not now favoured because of the lack of resuability of the floatation rafts and in each case, considerable extra problems of fabrication are introduced. The most complex and time consuming fabrication for self-floating jackets is for the floatation legs on the ground,,and this must be substantially complete before the main jacket structure can be built. This.complicatps and extends the fabrication process. A four legged structure without provision for installation will generally weight less because of the reduced wave forces and more open structure. It is not as redundant as an eight leggedft jacket and fabrication details at nodes are more complex although there are fewer nodes. Generally therefore, where possbile, barge launched jackets appearto be the most approporate. Recently the Murchison field development has extended the proven range .of barge launching, although at this stage the Magnus jacket in 180 of water was considered too large and was designed as self-floating tower. For the structures considered in this study, with light pay- loads, it would seem logical to use barge launched structure. However, it may be possible, with the heavy lifting capacities now available, to consider lifting the structure into position from barge. This is common method of installation else- where in the world, but has not been attempted in the Northern North Sea. The final alternative, which has not been attemped on any major jacket, is to consider side launching of jacket. This final option, whilst potentially attractive, is not considered in this study because it relies on equipment that does not at present exist. b. Structural Weights The weight of the jacket for the full drilling rig and barge launched case Was evaluated from member by member sizing exercise, leading to jacket weight which would be expected to be within 10% of the final design weight.

Influence of Method of Installation Barge launching the structure on location is the conventional method of installation, followed by controlled flooding to up- right the structure and final sinking to the seabed. If such a method is adopted, at least one face of the structure must have two parallel lauch tracks, and strong launch truss must be incorporated internally. This implies that at least legs must be used arranged in two rows of 4. The major disadvantage of such an eight-leg structure is that the wave force attracted are larger than for more open four legged structure . This is only true, however, if provision for installation is not considered and for heavier structures. The conventional North Sea approach has been to build large self-floating legs, which attract considerable extra wave force, (e.g. Thistle, Ninian, Magnus) or fabricate purpose built floa- taion rafts, which can be submerged with the structure atta- ched (e.g. Froties). The Forties system is not now favoured because of the lack of resuability of the floatation rafts and in each case, considerable extra problems of fabrication are introduced. The most complex and time consuming fabrication for self-floating jackets is for the floatation legs on the ground,,and this must be substantially complete before the main jacket structure can be built. This.complicatps and extends the fabrication process. A four legged structure without provision for installation will generally weight less because of the reduced wave forces and more open structure. It is not as redundant as an eight leggedft jacket and fabrication details at nodes are more complex although there are fewer nodes. Generally therefore, where possbile, barge launched jackets appearto be the most approporate. Recently the Murchison field development has extended the proven range .of barge launching, although at this stage the Magnus jacket in 180 of water was considered too large and was designed as self-floating tower. For the structures considered in this study, with light pay- loads, it would seem logical to use barge launched structure. However, it may be possible, with the heavy lifting capacities now available, to consider lifting the structure into position from barge. This is common method of installation else- where in the world, but has not been attempted in the Northern North Sea. The final alternative, which has not been attemped on any major jacket, is to consider side launching of jacket. This final option, whilst potentially attractive, is not considered in this study because it relies on equipment that does not at present exist. b. Structural Weights The weight of the jacket for the full drilling rig and barge launched case Was evaluated from member by member sizing exercise, leading to jacket weight which would be expected to be within 10% of the final design weight. See Fig. E-4. For the launched jacket with workover facilities only, the weight summery is shown in Fig, E-5. The weight of an alternative four legged structure is shown in Fig. E-6.E.1.1.5 Structural Alternatives A range of alternatives to piled steel jackets have been evaluated for the development of the 15/5 marginal field. One may conclude that today there are no clear guidelines as to which type of structures are the most suitable.

This option entails heavier rig and considerably more drill- pipe and casing and other consumables on the platform than the workover rig in the pre-drilling scheme. After completion of the wells, it is worth considering whether there is an economic case for removal of this rig and selling it, then bringing on rented workover rig for the brief periods when it is required in the future. This would eliminate the heavy maintenance cost of keeping the original rig out there for workovers during the working life of the platform. How- ever, the platform still has to be designed to be large enough to accommodate the larqe initial drilling rig. It is evident that drilling cannot start until the larger plat- form and jacket have been designed, built, placed, and then all the modlues installed on the deck, using an expensive der- rick barge spred. After initial installation and commissioning of the drilling rig modules and provision of accommodation and services, it will be possible to commence drilling while hook- up continues on the production modlues. d. Miscellaneous The two optional drilling modes would require different levels of storage capacity for fuel, drilling equipment, well consuma- bles, and stores. By pre-drilling, the wells, alle the drilling equipment, well consumables, and stores to support the drilling operation will have been channelled through the semi-submersible operation leaving only the tie-back and drilling out capacity require- ment of the workover rig requiring support. The high level of CO2 will demand strictly controlled practices to deal with corrosion. These will include continuous injection of filming amine inhibitor as well as glycol to prevent the formation of hydrates. . . E Platform Configuration For the purposes of this study, it was decided to adopt con- ventional piled jacket as the basis of.comparison. The design of such structures is well proven, and reliable weight and cost estimates for the structure can be developed with comparative ease. Time and costs of installation of such structures are prone to uncertainties such as weather and the market supply, an demand of offshore support units. Nevertheless, sufficient historical information from North Sea operations is available to realistically quantify the likely range of costs. A piled steel jacket of this sort is probably not the most cost effective fixed structure for this location. Section 1.1.5 deals with the alternatives that exist and from this superficial examination, it is probable that the single leg jack-up concept, with pre-commissioned topside equipment installed over predrilled template would be comparable in cost. a.

Otherwise, approximate weight guidelines are given where appropriate. a. Articulated Towers Articulated towers have found use as flare towers, and loa- ding facilities in the North Sea. Generally low payload has been required. Designs are feasible for payloads up to 000 tonnes, so that wave loading 3oes n-Dt induce excessive cyclic loading range on the lower articulation. Figure E-7 shows design found feasible for 000 tonnes payload and probable rela- tionship between total steel weight and topside payload is shown in Figure E-8. In shallower water with large payload requirements it is difficult to reconcile the conflicting requirements of main- taining the vertical cyclic loading within practical r.ange and ensuring the structure is stable in the event of joint failure. It is probable that for 120 water depth 000 tonnes is the maximum practical paylod. As well as this limi- tation, the reliability of the articulation and flexible risers around the articulation would require closer scrutiny. Elastomeric universal joint designs do allow for high pressure flow through them. This is limited to two lines, and it is unlikely that the maximum diameter possible is adequate for gas flow. Generally, therefore, gas must be carried around the universal joint in flexible (Coflexip) pipes of comparatively large diameter. A field development using such structure would probably re- quire subsea manifold centre with drilling performed from semi-submersible. The number of risers would then be reduced to minimum and thus the complexity of the lower articulation reduced. typical development pattern is shown in Figure E-9 The probable limitation in payload of 000 tonnes, together with the mainentance requirements of the articulation and by- pass hoses suggest that this type of structure is not suitable. It should also be noted that it is unlikely that drilling or workover operations could be performed from the structure. b. Multi-leg Jackup Conventional multi-leg jackups are limited in the water depth for which they can be satisfactorily designed. The absence of bracing between the legs requires the legs and deck to act as a portal frame, where maximum moments occur at the moveable intersection between legs and deck. The complexity of design at these areas, together with the fundamental sway frequency effectively limits the economic maximum water depth. The largest jackups in operation in the North Sea are the DYVI, type DYVI Beta and DYVI Gamma. Each has claimed maximum operating depth of 107 (350 ft),and payload capacity of 4 000 tonnes, either as drilling or production equipment. fundamental natural frequency of sec can be expected at 95 m (310 ft) water depth with much reduced fatigue life. An independent study has shown that for water depth of just less than 100 (325 ft) and design wave of 25 (80 ft), converted DYVI jackup without foundation mat was deficient in fatigue life, and maximum stresses in deck and legs due to excessive dynamic magnification of the design wave. It may be possible to extend the depth capability of such jackup to 120 (390 ft) as requred for the field, by introdu- cing foundation mat. Alternatively, piled foundations providing fixity, and reducing the effective length of the legs can be used. The conductors required for tie back from template to the jackup need support and protect.ton, and this must be provided by small well protection jacket. Such jacket can be totally independent from the jackup or linked at the top. In the former case, allowance in the conductor design for consi- derable differential movement must be made. The weight of suitable well head protection jacket will be in the order of 250 tonnes with approximately 850 tonnes of piling in addition. The cost of purchase of second-hand DYVI type jackup is not quoted here, and must be subject of detailed negotiation. Conversion of the jackup involves the replacement of bottom sections of legs, removing drilling equipment, installing pro- duction equipment and fabrication of foundation mat with leg stubs and leg connection fabilities. The mat and stub legs can be expected to use 500 tonnes of structural steel. c. Non-Buoyant Jack-us An alternative to the conventional jack-up is the non-buoyant multi-leg jackup . The structure is transported by means ofbarge, which is not significant penalty for the one off transportation process. It is argued that the open truss deck is far more versatile, and production packages can be lifted in as and when required. For loading intensities and span to depth rations encountered in offshore structures, study has shown that there is no significant difference in steel weight. However, in can be expected that the plate girder type hull construction is more easily automated, and will fit in with established shipyard fabrication techniques. The fabrication .cost should therefore be less. It is not considered worthwhile pursuing the truss deck con- cept any further at present because it is subject to the same depth limitations as conventional jackup and is unlikely to be cheaper. However, the open structure of the deck may offer an advantage in versatility, and this will be considered if, during the course of the study, such need arises. The design of non-buoyant jack-up is covered in part at least by variety of patents in the name of James G. Brown & Assoc. Inc. (Houston). d. Single leg Jackup The concept of using central single leg, has been shown to extend the rafige of jackups beyond the accepted limitations of a multi-leg jackup. The basic structural action is changed from that of portal frame with highly unceratin degree of fixity at the base to vertical cantilever. Maximum stresses always occur at the intersection between the leg and the foun- dation, and not at the movable point of deck support.

Multi-leg Jackup Conventional multi-leg jackups are limited in the water depth for which they can be satisfactorily designed. The absence of bracing between the legs requires the legs and deck to act as a portal frame, where maximum moments occur at the moveable intersection between legs and deck. The complexity of design at these areas, together with the fundamental sway frequency effectively limits the economic maximum water depth. The largest jackups in operation in the North Sea are the DYVI, type DYVI Beta and DYVI Gamma. Each has claimed maximum operating depth of 107 (350 ft),and payload capacity of 4 000 tonnes, either as drilling or production equipment. fundamental natural frequency of sec can be expected at 95 m (310 ft) water depth with much reduced fatigue life. An independent study has shown that for water depth of just less than 100 (325 ft) and design wave of 25 (80 ft), converted DYVI jackup without foundation mat was deficient in fatigue life, and maximum stresses in deck and legs due to excessive dynamic magnification of the design wave. It may be possible to extend the depth capability of such jackup to 120 (390 ft) as requred for the field, by introdu- cing foundation mat. Alternatively, piled foundations providing fixity, and reducing the effective length of the legs can be used. The conductors required for tie back from template to the jackup need support and protect.ton, and this must be provided by small well protection jacket. Such jacket can be totally independent from the jackup or linked at the top. In the former case, allowance in the conductor design for consi- derable differential movement must be made. The weight of suitable well head protection jacket will be in the order of 250 tonnes with approximately 850 tonnes of piling in addition. The cost of purchase of second-hand DYVI type jackup is not quoted here, and must be subject of detailed negotiation. Conversion of the jackup involves the replacement of bottom sections of legs, removing drilling equipment, installing pro- duction equipment and fabrication of foundation mat with leg stubs and leg connection fabilities. The mat and stub legs can be expected to use 500 tonnes of structural steel. c. Non-Buoyant Jack-us An alternative to the conventional jack-up is the non-buoyant multi-leg jackup . The structure is transported by means ofbarge, which is not significant penalty for the one off transportation process. It is argued that the open truss deck is far more versatile, and production packages can be lifted in as and when required. For loading intensities and span to depth rations encountered in offshore structures, study has shown that there is no significant difference in steel weight. However, in can be expected that the plate girder type hull construction is more easily automated, and will fit in with established shipyard fabrication techniques. The fabrication .cost should therefore be less. It is not considered worthwhile pursuing the truss deck con- cept any further at present because it is subject to the same depth limitations as conventional jackup and is unlikely to be cheaper. However, the open structure of the deck may offer an advantage in versatility, and this will be considered if, during the course of the study, such need arises.

The largest jackups in operation in the North Sea are the DYVI, type DYVI Beta and DYVI Gamma. Each has claimed maximum operating depth of 107 (350 ft),and payload capacity of 4 000 tonnes, either as drilling or production equipment. fundamental natural frequency of sec can be expected at 95 m (310 ft) water depth with much reduced fatigue life. An independent study has shown that for water depth of just less than 100 (325 ft) and design wave of 25 (80 ft), converted DYVI jackup without foundation mat was deficient in fatigue life, and maximum stresses in deck and legs due to excessive dynamic magnification of the design wave. It may be possible to extend the depth capability of such jackup to 120 (390 ft) as requred for the field, by introdu- cing foundation mat. Alternatively, piled foundations providing fixity, and reducing the effective length of the legs can be used. The conductors required for tie back from template to the jackup need support and protect.ton, and this must be provided by small well protection jacket. Such jacket can be totally independent from the jackup or linked at the top. In the former case, allowance in the conductor design for consi- derable differential movement must be made. The weight of suitable well head protection jacket will be in the order of 250 tonnes with approximately 850 tonnes of piling in addition. The cost of purchase of second-hand DYVI type jackup is not quoted here, and must be subject of detailed negotiation. Conversion of the jackup involves the replacement of bottom sections of legs, removing drilling equipment, installing pro- duction equipment and fabrication of foundation mat with leg stubs and leg connection fabilities. The mat and stub legs can be expected to use 500 tonnes of structural steel. c. Non-Buoyant Jack-us An alternative to the conventional jack-up is the non-buoyant multi-leg jackup . The structure is transported by means ofbarge, which is not significant penalty for the one off transportation process. It is argued that the open truss deck is far more versatile, and production packages can be lifted in as and when required. For loading intensities and span to depth rations encountered in offshore structures, study has shown that there is no significant difference in steel weight. However, in can be expected that the plate girder type hull construction is more easily automated, and will fit in with established shipyard fabrication techniques. The fabrication .cost should therefore be less. It is not considered worthwhile pursuing the truss deck con- cept any further at present because it is subject to the same depth limitations as conventional jackup and is unlikely to be cheaper. However, the open structure of the deck may offer an advantage in versatility, and this will be considered if, during the course of the study, such need arises. The design of non-buoyant jack-up is covered in part at least by variety of patents in the name of James G. Brown & Assoc. Inc. (Houston). d. Single leg Jackup The concept of using central single leg, has been shown to extend the rafige of jackups beyond the accepted limitations of a multi-leg jackup. The basic structural action is changed from that of portal frame with highly unceratin degree of fixity at the base to vertical cantilever. Maximum stresses always occur at the intersection between the leg and the foun- dation, and not at the movable point of deck support. Installation of the structure relies on both the hull and the mat being watertight and buoyant, and is in four phases, fol- lowed by pre-loading the foundations.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What significantly differentiates a single leg jackup from a multi-leg jackup in wellbore 15/5-1?,"The concept of using central single leg, has been shown to extend the range of jackups beyond the accepted limitations of a multi-leg jackup.","In wellbore 15/5-1's context, a single leg jackup is distinct because it can extend the range of jackups beyond what's possible with a multi-leg jackup.",0.9

Pre- loading of the foundation is requirement for all jackup operations in the Northe Sea.

Steel Gravity Structure The steel gravity structure shown in Figure E-11 as an alterna- tive to the single leg jackup weights less than the single leg jackup. Unfortunately, the means of installation of such structure add considerably to the weight or complexity of operations. Two basiv alternatives exist: a) Installing the foundation mat independently, and connecting the jacket on location b) Providing large auciliary buoyancy tanks to provide stabi- lity during controlled flooding and sinking vertically. Option a)is extremely weather depdenent, both the sinking of the mat and the installation of tower. Both operations require the use of one or two derrick barges. Option b) has benefit if oil storage is required but for gas field development there is no significant use that can be made of the buoyancy tanks. The tanks would normally be desig- ned to support the full hydrostatic head and hence are heavy. It is estimated that provision of buoyancy tanks for control- led sinking operation without the deck installed would require buoyancy tanks weighing approximately 000 t. The complexity of the controlled flooding operation must not be underestimated and the operation cannot be performed with the deck installed. The use of such steel gravity structure for this location has advantages in that piling is not necessary.

T.F.L. system is also studied but not recommended. 'The trees will be controlled by means of an electro-hydraulic multiplex system from individual control pods, retrievable normally during workover operations, but which may also be diver retrievable using :a suitable support vessel. Initial wellhead pressure is 372 bar, and the wellhead flowing pressure is about 325 bar. Estimated wellhead temperature is 88C. The sales pipeline is designed for maximum working pressure of 170 bar and hence choking would initially be re- quired at each wellhead. The temperature drop across the chokes is estimated to maximum 22C, which will provide minimum gas temperature of 66C entering the pipeline. The field production profile provides for steady rate of drainage over the first four years of operation, during which time the wellhead flowing pressure will decline from 325 bar to 70 bar. Thereafter, pressure of 70 bar is main- tained by cutting back the flow from individual wells. (See Figures D-7, D-8 and Table D-5)A 20 diameter, multiphase flow, thermally insulated sales pipeline connects the subsea installation to the assumed central platform 20 km away. During initial operation, up to about 22% liquids are pre- dicted in the sales pipeline, and preliminary pipeline and slug catcher designs have been prepared on that basis. The multiphase flow will reach the central Sleipner platform at minimum pressure of 50 bar and temperature of approxi- mately 59C. With the proposed system, it will be possible to adjust the pipeline and the platform operating pressures within limits during the initial years when liquid production is highest, i.e. when multiphase operational problems will be most severe. In the event of major hold up of liquid during unstable conditions (e.g. after shut down), it will be possible to clear the sales pipeline by spheres from subsea sphere- launcher system holding up' to six spheres. With gas velocities up to about 14 m/sec (45 ft/sec) at full production, there should be no need to pass spheres during normal operation. Well testing would be carried out at surface vessel, equip- ped for drilling and testing operations, located above the well cluster. A pipeline between platform and subsea cluster is proposed for well killing. However killing from surface drilling vessel might provide adequate safety cover since most killing operations are under- taken in controlled circumstances. Glycol injection is required to prevent the formation of hyd- rates downhole, after the choke and in the pipeline during start-up. It will only be necessary for glycol to be injec- ted while individual wells are being brought on stream ancl after the sales pipeline has been shut down. Glycol would be supplied via pipeline pressurized to 480 bar at the cen- tral platform, and distributed via subsea manifold at the cluster. Mono-ethylene glycol is recommended for this purpbse because of its greater effectiveness per unit volume injected, and its lower viscosity which will reduce pumping costs. Corrosion inhibitor is required to be injected either conti- nuously or in regular doses to Prevent CO2 pitting corrosion in the tubing, manifold, and pipeline. Inhibitor may be sup- ik plied either via separate 1/2 pipeline to the cluster or blended in with glycol. The overall system is shown diagrammatically in figure E-12. The use of templated cluster of wells to produce field will yield advantages in installation and control of the wells. However, once all the wells on the template are completed and producing, re-entry requirements will almost certainly neces- sitate safety shutdowr, of all adjacent wells, at least during the running and retrieval of blow out preventers and tie-back risers. The conceptual sketch in figure E-13 shows the proposed tem- plate layout. It has 10 slots and near central manifold base. The Xmas trees are individually retrievable to allowfor major serviceingz, although much tree equipment is pro- posed to be diver serviceable without recourse to floating drilling vessel. Flowlines and service lines are pre-plumbed on the template between each slot and the manifold base. Vertical flow line connectors are provided to allow the trees to be stab connec- ted to the template plumbing. The near centrally mounted sphere launching/manifold base allows minimum bunching of pre-plumbed flowlines and is at the most protected point on the template. The template should be of tubular structure. Its configu- ration, piling points and height have been designed to pro- vide security against trawl board and anchor damage. The template needs six independent piles to secure it to the seabed and to avoid that the well casings will contribute to resisting trawl board and anchor loads. Template levelling , will be by diver intervention and hydraulic jacking systems. The height of the template is extended up to the top of the Xmas tree assemblies. The amount of steel construction may result in weight in air of up to 300 tonnes, including pre- plumbed pipe work, etc. The design of the template construction must allow easy and safe access by divers to each tree for servicing valves, actuators, chokes, and sensors.a. Downhole and wellhead Due to the remote location of the Xmas trees and the possi- bility of trawl board impact on them, consideration has to be given to the safety of the wells, if trees are torn off. It is recommended that each well should be equipped with two fail-safe downhole safety valves (DHSV) the lower DHSV to be tubing retrievable and the upper one to be wireline retrieva- ble. It should be mentioned that no examples are known of such an arrangement in current practice. At the wellhead, between the 5/8 casing and the lower down- hole safety valve, five tubes have to be accomodated in the annulus. - 41/2 production tubing, in 12% chromium steel - short annulus access or kill string of minimum diameter 2 7/8 - Downhole mono-ethylene glycol injection line down to an in- jection valve/nozzle set just above the upper DHSV.

Glycol injection is required to prevent the formation of hyd- rates downhole, after the choke and in the pipeline during start-up. It will only be necessary for glycol to be injec- ted while individual wells are being brought on stream ancl after the sales pipeline has been shut down. Glycol would be supplied via pipeline pressurized to 480 bar at the cen- tral platform, and distributed via subsea manifold at the cluster. Mono-ethylene glycol is recommended for this purpbse because of its greater effectiveness per unit volume injected, and its lower viscosity which will reduce pumping costs. Corrosion inhibitor is required to be injected either conti- nuously or in regular doses to Prevent CO2 pitting corrosion in the tubing, manifold, and pipeline. Inhibitor may be sup- ik plied either via separate 1/2 pipeline to the cluster or blended in with glycol. The overall system is shown diagrammatically in figure E-12. The use of templated cluster of wells to produce field will yield advantages in installation and control of the wells. However, once all the wells on the template are completed and producing, re-entry requirements will almost certainly neces- sitate safety shutdowr, of all adjacent wells, at least during the running and retrieval of blow out preventers and tie-back risers. The conceptual sketch in figure E-13 shows the proposed tem- plate layout. It has 10 slots and near central manifold base. The Xmas trees are individually retrievable to allowfor major serviceingz, although much tree equipment is pro- posed to be diver serviceable without recourse to floating drilling vessel. Flowlines and service lines are pre-plumbed on the template between each slot and the manifold base. Vertical flow line connectors are provided to allow the trees to be stab connec- ted to the template plumbing. The near centrally mounted sphere launching/manifold base allows minimum bunching of pre-plumbed flowlines and is at the most protected point on the template. The template should be of tubular structure. Its configu- ration, piling points and height have been designed to pro- vide security against trawl board and anchor damage. The template needs six independent piles to secure it to the seabed and to avoid that the well casings will contribute to resisting trawl board and anchor loads. Template levelling , will be by diver intervention and hydraulic jacking systems. The height of the template is extended up to the top of the Xmas tree assemblies. The amount of steel construction may result in weight in air of up to 300 tonnes, including pre- plumbed pipe work, etc. The design of the template construction must allow easy and safe access by divers to each tree for servicing valves, actuators, chokes, and sensors.a. Downhole and wellhead Due to the remote location of the Xmas trees and the possi- bility of trawl board impact on them, consideration has to be given to the safety of the wells, if trees are torn off. It is recommended that each well should be equipped with two fail-safe downhole safety valves (DHSV) the lower DHSV to be tubing retrievable and the upper one to be wireline retrieva- ble. It should be mentioned that no examples are known of such an arrangement in current practice. At the wellhead, between the 5/8 casing and the lower down- hole safety valve, five tubes have to be accomodated in the annulus. - 41/2 production tubing, in 12% chromium steel - short annulus access or kill string of minimum diameter 2 7/8 - Downhole mono-ethylene glycol injection line down to an in- jection valve/nozzle set just above the upper DHSV.

At the top of the tree above the swab valves should be tie- back or re-rentry spool piece to allow vertical entry to thewell for workover purposes. Normally corrosion cap will be set on top of the tie-back spool. In addition to the corro- sion cap, surrounding it and at about the same level should be fitted debris protection cap. This extends between the guide posts and protect the rest of the tree, valve actuators, flowlines, control pod, etc. from falling debris. It is recommended that vertical flowline connectors are employed to ease the installation of the tree onto the template and mani- fold during completion and tie-in, and any subsequent major workover which may involve pulling the tree. Use of vertical flowline, glycol, inhibitor and kill line connections will allow more pre-plumbing of the temnlate and manifold, thereby reducing the subsea plumbing content. All the valves, with the exception of the annulus and produc- tion swab valves, will be under production control from the central platform. . During workover and completion operations, workover control will be established which will inhibit pro- duction control, and also operate the swab valves and other hydraulic functions not associated with production operations. The inclusion of Hi-Lo pilot is recommended to provide automatic shutdown control, although the use of these pilots subsea is not understood to be proven practice. The production chokes will be of the multiple orifice type. The entire choke should be diver replaceable. The choke is hydraulically operated by using reversible pressure com- pensated stepping actuator. Flow rates can be approximated by reference to differential pressure and choke aperture. Production fluids are passed from the choke, through control valve, to the production manifold. A life of nine months to three years can be expected from the production choke trim. It is recommended that regular annual replacement of all discs is carried out. Injection metering is required both down hole and into the production fluids. The glycol/inhibitor supply is providedfrom an injection supply manifold through an individual inlet control valve. The amount of fluid to be injected may vary considerably as the proportions of glycol and corrosion inhi- bitor are varied. It is, therefore, proposed that remote controllable regulating device is used for production injec- tion. Examples of subsea variable displacement metering pumps have not been found and would, no doubt, provide maintenance complications. It is proposed that the regulating function is carried out by remote control valves and variable choke at each wellhead, provided with injection fluid under suitable pressure from common manifold. The tree diagram in fig. E-14 shows the proposed location of the various sensors of pressure, temperature, sand, and corro- sion. In general, the use of sensors subsea is not widespread. All sensors should be diver replaceable, and it is recommended that, for every sensor position shown on the diagram, at least two are actually fitted, to provide redundancy.

The manifold system is pre-plumbed into the template for ease of installation. See Fig. E-15. The production manifold'is rated for 410 bar, and the service manifolds and lines are rated for 430 bar. The sales pipeline is, however, designed for 170 bar. To protect the sales pipe- line against overpressure, it is proposed to connect an emer- gency relief system to the sales manifold leading away from the template. The relief valve would be actuated by excessline pressure and would re-set automatically. In the event of an emergency well shut-in being delayed, the relief system would allow short controlled gas blow-out situation to exist at safe distance from the cluster without damaging the installation. b. Subsea S2here Launcher It is anticipated that the sales pipeline will need to be pigged during operation to clear condensate slugs or hydrate deposits formed during periods of shutdown or low throughput. It is also .recommended that slug of inhibited glycol, sepa- rated from the gas stream by spheres is passed down the sales line after every shutdown period. The sphere launching system as shown in fig. E-16, which forms separate tree, will be connected to the sales line by 20 collet type vertical connector and to the glycol manifold, by stab connector. The sphere launching tree can be run down conventional guide wires and latched onto its rear central guide base. The glycol, inhibitor and kill mani- folds are tied into their respective pipelines by diver made connections. Operation of all valves, etc. would be controlled from one control pod. For sphere release during operation, control would be from the central platform. For sphere loading, the production control pod may be used but, preferably, it may be replaced with hydraulic workover pod controlled directly from the support vessel. Retrieval of the sphere launching tree, as proposed, would be major operation involving shut-down and purging of the sales . pipeline and disconnection of 20 subsea flange.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What is located at the top of the tree in the wellbore 15/5-1?,Tie- back or re-rentry spool piece,"At the top of the tree in the wellbore 15/5-1, there is a tie-back or re-rentry spool piece",1

It is proposed that the regulating function is carried out by remote control valves and variable choke at each wellhead, provided with injection fluid under suitable pressure from common manifold. The tree diagram in fig. E-14 shows the proposed location of the various sensors of pressure, temperature, sand, and corro- sion. In general, the use of sensors subsea is not widespread.

E.1.2.4 The Manifolds and Sphere Launching Systems a. Manifolds - Each tree will be connected to the sales manifold, the kill manifold, the inhibitor manifold, and the glycol manifold by vertical stab type connectors. The manifold system is pre-plumbed into the template for ease of installation. See Fig. E-15. The production manifold'is rated for 410 bar, and the service manifolds and lines are rated for 430 bar. The sales pipeline is, however, designed for 170 bar. To protect the sales pipe- line against overpressure, it is proposed to connect an emer- gency relief system to the sales manifold leading away from the template. The relief valve would be actuated by excessline pressure and would re-set automatically. In the event of an emergency well shut-in being delayed, the relief system would allow short controlled gas blow-out situation to exist at safe distance from the cluster without damaging the installation. b. Subsea S2here Launcher It is anticipated that the sales pipeline will need to be pigged during operation to clear condensate slugs or hydrate deposits formed during periods of shutdown or low throughput. It is also .recommended that slug of inhibited glycol, sepa- rated from the gas stream by spheres is passed down the sales line after every shutdown period. The sphere launching system as shown in fig. E-16, which forms separate tree, will be connected to the sales line by 20 collet type vertical connector and to the glycol manifold, by stab connector. The sphere launching tree can be run down conventional guide wires and latched onto its rear central guide base. The glycol, inhibitor and kill mani- folds are tied into their respective pipelines by diver made connections. Operation of all valves, etc. would be controlled from one control pod. For sphere release during operation, control would be from the central platform. For sphere loading, the production control pod may be used but, preferably, it may be replaced with hydraulic workover pod controlled directly from the support vessel.

E.1.2.5 Sales Pipelines and Cables a.

A corrosion coating is necessary on the 24 casing, backed up by sacrificial anode bracelets. sketch of the pipeline is shown in figure E-17. It is proposed to trench the sales pipeline but not to bury it. The outer casing will also provide mechanical protection against trawl board damage. b. Service Line Bundle C. A second pipeline is proposed for service and control purposes. This pipeline comprises the following bundle of service lines in 12 casing: (see fig. E-17). - One kill line - One glycol injection line - One hydraulic fluid bundle - One 0,5 inhibitor line - Two power and signal cables'. The weakest part of this service bundle is the subsea termination of the electrical cables. Connector failures are the most likely cause of failure in the transmission system and this leads to limited confidence in electro- hydraulic control system. Because of the present status of subsea electrical terminations, two power and signal cables are recommended in the service line bundle. E.1.2.6 Subsea Control System For field to be remotely operated over distance of 20 km, a Multiplex Electro-Hydraulic Control System with double sub- sea redundancy and with sequenced Hydraulic Control backup is recommended. See figure E-18. The subsea control element should include dual independent power supplies and electronics packages. Use of high relia- bility components is necessary specially selected and tested for this application. Packaging in dry one atmosphere pod is preferred. An appropriate configuration for the subsea control system will be control pod at each tree or one centralized con- trolpod on the template (see Table E-3). All control functions leave the pod as hydraulic commands and activiate well proven subsea hydraulic valve actuators The hydraulic commands should originate from hydraulic operators within the pod. The hydraulic supply for the control pod and valve actuators will come from an accumulator bank. Multiplexing and message coding/decoding techniques are well establiched in telemetry and can be expected to be the most reliable part of the control system. In the event of total failure of electrical power or signal, the master and wing valve should close automatically. These can be reopened by the back-up sequenced hydraulic controlsystem. The expected time delay for this back-up system to operate valve is in the range from 10 to 30 minutes, which is why it is only suitable as back-up tool in this applica- tion. E.1.2.7 Installation, Operation and Maintenance a. Installation The preplumbed template, fitted with buoyancy tanks, will be towed out on barge. The template will be lowered to its position on the seabed. self contained semi-submersible drilling rig will then conduct well drilling through the template and the subsequent completion and testing. The drilling rig will also run and set the wellhead xmas trees to the template wellheads. Vertical connection to the manifolds will also be made and diver's used to check the connections. Using workover hydraulic control pod, each tree operation can be checked when set. The pipelines can be laid during well drilling and completion phases, provided care is taken when laying the semi-submer- sibles anchor pattern. The pipeline tie-in spool pieces can also be designed and fabricated. Final pipeline tie-in, electro-hydraulic connections and testing will take place once the last tree is set. b. Operation and Maintenance The well control design and proposed facilities will provide a high degree of flexibility in the handling of opening and closing procedures, both for normal and emergency situations. Additional valve operations, or changes in sequence, can be incorporated relatively easily before or after installation by changes in the computer software which controls these operations. Workover operations should be conducted by direct vertical access to each well from floating drilling vessel. An annual workover/welltesting is assumed which involves entering every well, at least to provide inspection of the DHSV's. Most downhole operations can be conducted by wireline techniques through marine riser tied into the well tie- back or re-entry spool.

E.1.2.6 Subsea Control System For field to be remotely operated over distance of 20 km, a Multiplex Electro-Hydraulic Control System with double sub- sea redundancy and with sequenced Hydraulic Control backup is recommended. See figure E-18. The subsea control element should include dual independent power supplies and electronics packages. Use of high relia- bility components is necessary specially selected and tested for this application. Packaging in dry one atmosphere pod is preferred. An appropriate configuration for the subsea control system will be control pod at each tree or one centralized con- trolpod on the template (see Table E-3). All control functions leave the pod as hydraulic commands and activiate well proven subsea hydraulic valve actuators The hydraulic commands should originate from hydraulic operators within the pod. The hydraulic supply for the control pod and valve actuators will come from an accumulator bank. Multiplexing and message coding/decoding techniques are well establiched in telemetry and can be expected to be the most reliable part of the control system. In the event of total failure of electrical power or signal, the master and wing valve should close automatically. These can be reopened by the back-up sequenced hydraulic controlsystem. The expected time delay for this back-up system to operate valve is in the range from 10 to 30 minutes, which is why it is only suitable as back-up tool in this applica- tion. E.1.2.7 Installation, Operation and Maintenance a. Installation The preplumbed template, fitted with buoyancy tanks, will be towed out on barge. The template will be lowered to its position on the seabed. self contained semi-submersible drilling rig will then conduct well drilling through the template and the subsequent completion and testing. The drilling rig will also run and set the wellhead xmas trees to the template wellheads. Vertical connection to the manifolds will also be made and diver's used to check the connections. Using workover hydraulic control pod, each tree operation can be checked when set. The pipelines can be laid during well drilling and completion phases, provided care is taken when laying the semi-submer- sibles anchor pattern. The pipeline tie-in spool pieces can also be designed and fabricated. Final pipeline tie-in, electro-hydraulic connections and testing will take place once the last tree is set. b. Operation and Maintenance The well control design and proposed facilities will provide a high degree of flexibility in the handling of opening and closing procedures, both for normal and emergency situations. Additional valve operations, or changes in sequence, can be incorporated relatively easily before or after installation by changes in the computer software which controls these operations. Workover operations should be conducted by direct vertical access to each well from floating drilling vessel. An annual workover/welltesting is assumed which involves entering every well, at least to provide inspection of the DHSV's. Most downhole operations can be conducted by wireline techniques through marine riser tied into the well tie- back or re-entry spool. Heave compensation would have to be incorporated into the wireline controls.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What is the proposed method for the subsea control system for the wellbore 15/5-1?,Multiplex Electro-Hydraulic Control System with double subsea redundancy and with sequenced Hydraulic Control backup,The proposed method for the subsea control system in wellbore 15/5-1 is a Multiplex Electro-Hydraulic Control System.

The expected time delay for this back-up system to operate valve is in the range from 10 to 30 minutes, which is why it is only suitable as back-up tool in this applica- tion. E.1.2.7 Installation, Operation and Maintenance a. Installation The preplumbed template, fitted with buoyancy tanks, will be towed out on barge. The template will be lowered to its position on the seabed. self contained semi-submersible drilling rig will then conduct well drilling through the template and the subsequent completion and testing. The drilling rig will also run and set the wellhead xmas trees to the template wellheads. Vertical connection to the manifolds will also be made and diver's used to check the connections. Using workover hydraulic control pod, each tree operation can be checked when set. The pipelines can be laid during well drilling and completion phases, provided care is taken when laying the semi-submer- sibles anchor pattern. The pipeline tie-in spool pieces can also be designed and fabricated. Final pipeline tie-in, electro-hydraulic connections and testing will take place once the last tree is set. b. Operation and Maintenance The well control design and proposed facilities will provide a high degree of flexibility in the handling of opening and closing procedures, both for normal and emergency situations. Additional valve operations, or changes in sequence, can be incorporated relatively easily before or after installation by changes in the computer software which controls these operations. Workover operations should be conducted by direct vertical access to each well from floating drilling vessel. An annual workover/welltesting is assumed which involves entering every well, at least to provide inspection of the DHSV's. Most downhole operations can be conducted by wireline techniques through marine riser tied into the well tie- back or re-entry spool. Heave compensation would have to be incorporated into the wireline controls.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What purpose does the outer casing serve in wellbore 15/5-1?,The outer casing will also provide mechanical protection against trawl board damage,"In the wellbore 15/5-1 design, the outer casing is important for providing mechanical protection against any potential damage from trawl boards.",1

Well testing should be done during the workover period from the same drilling vessel. Most well killing operations that are foreseen can be carried out during, normal planned workover operations from drilling vessel. It is for the operations that cannot be foreseen that an emergency, high pressure kill line may be required. The most likely potential blow-out situation that may occur is felt to be where packer failure or other perforation causes an annulus pressure leak. Where an annulus leak is discovered, depending on its nature, it can be bled into the production flow-line via the crossover valve, or it can be shut off at the well head, allowing unknown pressure to build up in the annulus, or the annulus can be flooded with kill fluid to seal it and control the leak. All these actions are temporary pending full workover availability. The advantage of kill line is to be able to control the annulus with kill fluid immediately from the platform. The cost of high pressure kill line, mainifold valves, mud pumps, mixing equipment and the kill fluid solution itself, has to set against this advantage.

The condensate arrives through condensate riser, sphere receiver and into coalescer unit: From here the condensate is fed into an assumed common condensate treatment, com- pression and storage system after custody transfer metering. The gas arrives through gas riser, sphere receiver and into an inlet separation unit where the pipeline condensate is knocked out. The condensate is dumped into the condensate line upstream of the coalescer. As the gas is dehydrated at the 15/5 platform no further de- hydration should be necessary at the Sleipner platform. Before entering the assumed common gas treatment/compression system, the gas should go through custo transfer metering station as the gas and the condensate might be sold to different customers.

The main corrosion and material problems on Block 15/5 (Dagny gas field) are related to the high reservoir pressure, high reservoir temperature and relatively high CO2-content'in the gas. These factors will dominate the selection of tubing materials and inhibitor programs, and also the selection of materials for the flare system, and any flowline from subsea completion systems to process platform. The evaluation of materials, corrosion and corrosion prevention is based on the reservoir data given in section D. As normal experience, but, not always, H2S is present in hydrocarbons containing CO2. Further, the H2S concentration tends to increase with productiontime. Based on this, and the unaccurate H2S-analysis for 15/5, and the fact that the close 15/6 Sleipner gas has 16 ppm H2S, the effect of H2S should be evaluated although only traces are detected. The chloride concentration of 15/5 is not analysed, but based on normal North Sea reservoir chloride content of 1-10% and the 15/5 tubing temperature range 75-125C, the environ- ment in the 15/5 wells would be highly corrosive. If, in addition, solid particles are produced, the situation will be even worse as erosion of protective layers and metal will take place, accelerating erosioncorrosion attacks. These problems are discussed in appendix 5, and summary is given in the following. Tubing corrosion can be prevented by use of: 1. Carbon steel or low alloy steel combined with downhole inhibitor injection. 2. Corrosion resistant materials. 3. Carbon steel or low alloy steel combined with internal coatings. Alternative No. is normally not recommended due to problems related to Application of coating free from pin holes. Proper coating of joints. Risk of damaging the coating by internal tools. Difficulties in coating repair. Alternative No. Carbon steel tubing materials like C-75, L-80 and C-95 are resistant to H2S stress corrosion when fabricated and applied in accordance with API SPEC AC and NACE Standard MR-01-75 (1978 Revision). The materials are, however, not resistant to CO2 corrosion, which makes downhole inhibitor injection necessary. This is also true for low alloy materials like AIS1 4130 and SAE 4135. Within this group of materials, L-80 is recommended for the 15/5 Dagny field due to strength requirements. Inquiries have been made to various suppliers of corrosion inhibitors for their recommendations as to inhibitor treat- ment, based on the 15/5 field data. The proposed inhibitors were of neutralizing and filming amine type, soluble in water and glycol. The final selection of inhibitors for down- hole continuously injection program must be based on the actual and detailed environmental data for Block 15/5. It is recommended that the most promising inhibitor blends are comprehensively tested under conditions simulating the severe environment of 15/5, e.g. gunk tests in high pressure, high temperature autoclaves for at least one month time each run to test stability and lifetime. The tests should include checking of film persistency to high gas velocities (15 m/s), corrosion rates of tubing materials in inhibited, actual environment, as well as agressivity of inhibitor blends to gasket materials in the downhole'quipment. The latter has been problem for some North Sea fields, where CO2 corrosion inhibitor mixtures injected downhole, have dis- solved iubber gaskets, o-rings etc. Alternative No.2 Although alternative No. is most frequently used to date, there is an increasing interest in application of resistant materials to avoid complicated and costly inhibitor injection systems. The application of such materials on block No. 15/5 is evaluated. The evaluation is based on discussions with tubing manufacturers, oil companies and DnV together with a litterature survey and Norsk Hydra's own experience from onshore applications. Stainless Steels The resistant tubing materials recommended by tubing manufactures for the present application are martensitic and ferritic-austenitic stainless steels. The chemical composition and mechanical properties of these materialsare listed in Table E-2. This figure also include some austenitic stainless steels which are found interesting based on Norsk Hydro's own experience. All the materials listed are resistant to wet CO2 corrosion due to chromium content above 12%. With possible question mark on the 13% Cr materials, they are also re- sistant to H2S: Normally chromium stainless steels are not considered resistant in this respect. However, the qualities listed are claimed by the manufacturers to have the same resistance as L-80 tubing due to special quenching and tempering treatment. This seems to be in agreement with NACE Standard MR-01-75 (1978 Revision). All the materials listed are considered fairly resistant to ahloride stress cracking, but the resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion at temperatures of 85-125.c and different chloride concentration needs further evaluation. The tubing manufactures contacted have not been able (or willing) to document critical chloride concentration below which their stainless steels could be safely used without suffering from pitting or crevice corrosion at these temperatures.

The main corrosion and material problems on Block 15/5 (Dagny gas field) are related to the high reservoir pressure, high reservoir temperature and relatively high CO2-content'in the gas. These factors will dominate the selection of tubing materials and inhibitor programs, and also the selection of materials for the flare system, and any flowline from subsea completion systems to process platform. The evaluation of materials, corrosion and corrosion prevention is based on the reservoir data given in section D. As normal experience, but, not always, H2S is present in hydrocarbons containing CO2. Further, the H2S concentration tends to increase with productiontime. Based on this, and the unaccurate H2S-analysis for 15/5, and the fact that the close 15/6 Sleipner gas has 16 ppm H2S, the effect of H2S should be evaluated although only traces are detected. The chloride concentration of 15/5 is not analysed, but based on normal North Sea reservoir chloride content of 1-10% and the 15/5 tubing temperature range 75-125C, the environ- ment in the 15/5 wells would be highly corrosive. If, in addition, solid particles are produced, the situation will be even worse as erosion of protective layers and metal will take place, accelerating erosioncorrosion attacks. These problems are discussed in appendix 5, and summary is given in the following. Tubing corrosion can be prevented by use of: 1. Carbon steel or low alloy steel combined with downhole inhibitor injection. 2. Corrosion resistant materials. 3. Carbon steel or low alloy steel combined with internal coatings. Alternative No. is normally not recommended due to problems related to Application of coating free from pin holes. Proper coating of joints. Risk of damaging the coating by internal tools. Difficulties in coating repair. Alternative No. Carbon steel tubing materials like C-75, L-80 and C-95 are resistant to H2S stress corrosion when fabricated and applied in accordance with API SPEC AC and NACE Standard MR-01-75 (1978 Revision). The materials are, however, not resistant to CO2 corrosion, which makes downhole inhibitor injection necessary. This is also true for low alloy materials like AIS1 4130 and SAE 4135. Within this group of materials, L-80 is recommended for the 15/5 Dagny field due to strength requirements. Inquiries have been made to various suppliers of corrosion inhibitors for their recommendations as to inhibitor treat- ment, based on the 15/5 field data. The proposed inhibitors were of neutralizing and filming amine type, soluble in water and glycol. The final selection of inhibitors for down- hole continuously injection program must be based on the actual and detailed environmental data for Block 15/5. It is recommended that the most promising inhibitor blends are comprehensively tested under conditions simulating the severe environment of 15/5, e.g. gunk tests in high pressure, high temperature autoclaves for at least one month time each run to test stability and lifetime. The tests should include checking of film persistency to high gas velocities (15 m/s), corrosion rates of tubing materials in inhibited, actual environment, as well as agressivity of inhibitor blends to gasket materials in the downhole'quipment. The latter has been problem for some North Sea fields, where CO2 corrosion inhibitor mixtures injected downhole, have dis- solved iubber gaskets, o-rings etc. Alternative No.2 Although alternative No. is most frequently used to date, there is an increasing interest in application of resistant materials to avoid complicated and costly inhibitor injection systems. The application of such materials on block No. 15/5 is evaluated. The evaluation is based on discussions with tubing manufacturers, oil companies and DnV together with a litterature survey and Norsk Hydra's own experience from onshore applications. Stainless Steels The resistant tubing materials recommended by tubing manufactures for the present application are martensitic and ferritic-austenitic stainless steels. The chemical composition and mechanical properties of these materialsare listed in Table E-2. This figure also include some austenitic stainless steels which are found interesting based on Norsk Hydro's own experience. All the materials listed are resistant to wet CO2 corrosion due to chromium content above 12%. With possible question mark on the 13% Cr materials, they are also re- sistant to H2S: Normally chromium stainless steels are not considered resistant in this respect. However, the qualities listed are claimed by the manufacturers to have the same resistance as L-80 tubing due to special quenching and tempering treatment. This seems to be in agreement with NACE Standard MR-01-75 (1978 Revision). All the materials listed are considered fairly resistant to ahloride stress cracking, but the resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion at temperatures of 85-125.c and different chloride concentration needs further evaluation.

The main corrosion and material problems on Block 15/5 (Dagny gas field) are related to the high reservoir pressure, high reservoir temperature and relatively high CO2-content'in the gas. These factors will dominate the selection of tubing materials and inhibitor programs, and also the selection of materials for the flare system, and any flowline from subsea completion systems to process platform. The evaluation of materials, corrosion and corrosion prevention is based on the reservoir data given in section D. As normal experience, but, not always, H2S is present in hydrocarbons containing CO2. Further, the H2S concentration tends to increase with productiontime. Based on this, and the unaccurate H2S-analysis for 15/5, and the fact that the close 15/6 Sleipner gas has 16 ppm H2S, the effect of H2S should be evaluated although only traces are detected. The chloride concentration of 15/5 is not analysed, but based on normal North Sea reservoir chloride content of 1-10% and the 15/5 tubing temperature range 75-125C, the environ- ment in the 15/5 wells would be highly corrosive. If, in addition, solid particles are produced, the situation will be even worse as erosion of protective layers and metal will take place, accelerating erosioncorrosion attacks. These problems are discussed in appendix 5, and summary is given in the following. Tubing corrosion can be prevented by use of: 1. Carbon steel or low alloy steel combined with downhole inhibitor injection. 2. Corrosion resistant materials. 3. Carbon steel or low alloy steel combined with internal coatings.

Alternative No. Carbon steel tubing materials like C-75, L-80 and C-95 are resistant to H2S stress corrosion when fabricated and applied in accordance with API SPEC AC and NACE Standard MR-01-75 (1978 Revision). The materials are, however, not resistant to CO2 corrosion, which makes downhole inhibitor injection necessary. This is also true for low alloy materials like AIS1 4130 and SAE 4135. Within this group of materials, L-80 is recommended for the 15/5 Dagny field due to strength requirements.

The proposed inhibitors were of neutralizing and filming amine type, soluble in water and glycol. The final selection of inhibitors for down- hole continuously injection program must be based on the actual and detailed environmental data for Block 15/5. It is recommended that the most promising inhibitor blends are comprehensively tested under conditions simulating the severe environment of 15/5, e.g. gunk tests in high pressure, high temperature autoclaves for at least one month time each run to test stability and lifetime. The tests should include checking of film persistency to high gas velocities (15 m/s), corrosion rates of tubing materials in inhibited, actual environment, as well as agressivity of inhibitor blends to gasket materials in the downhole'quipment. The latter has been problem for some North Sea fields, where CO2 corrosion inhibitor mixtures injected downhole, have dis- solved iubber gaskets, o-rings etc. Alternative No.2 Although alternative No. is most frequently used to date, there is an increasing interest in application of resistant materials to avoid complicated and costly inhibitor injection systems. The application of such materials on block No. 15/5 is evaluated. The evaluation is based on discussions with tubing manufacturers, oil companies and DnV together with a litterature survey and Norsk Hydra's own experience from onshore applications.

401,DISCOVERY_EVALUATION_REPORT,db015483bd0adb1d450b5422de4cd6b07474ae89,40,"The most interesting alternatives become the martensitic and the cold worked ferritic-austenitic materials. The coldworked materials are however quite new on the market. The only field experience is 11/2 year exposure of 20% cold worked material in German field. Based on offers per February 1979, the material costs of martensitic 13% Cr and ferittic-austenitic tubing are respectively 4-5 and 7-8 times that of L-80 tubing. Other corrosion resistant materials Application of exotic materials like special Ni-Cr-No-Mn alloy in Germany and Cr-Mo-Co alloys in the USA are reported in the litterature. Such materials are not included in the present discussion as they are intended for the most severe environments (e.g. 27-46% H2S, 3-10% CO2) and the costs would be prohibitive. The effectiveness of corrosion prevention by inhibitor injection or use of resistant tubing materials should be monitored. This can be done by direct or indirect methods of detection. The disadvantage of the direct methods (e.g. observation and. measurements of damaged equipment, inspection by tools like the tubing caliper, records of leaks, repair and re- placements) is that the results are available only after some damage has taken place. By application of indirect methods the corrosion rate can be estimate before any significant damage has occured. The indirect methods most frequently used, are based on weight loss of corrosion coupons installed in the process steam, corrosometers measuring increase in electrical resistance as the thickness of probes are reduced by corrosion, and the corrater which is similar to the corrosmeter, but measuresthe galvanic current between small corroding steel electrodes (linear polarization probes). It is not found appropriate to go into detailed evaluation of the different methods at this stage in the project, but it should be mentioned that corrosion monitoring probes and instrumentation now are used more and more extensively in the North Sea. Often the operators having suffered sudden breakdown of equipment/tubings due to corrosion. Operators also claim that effective monitoring system of downhole inhibitor programs are essential, not only to monitor the inhibitor performance but also to optimize the dose rates and thereby costs. It is hardly thinkable that the very corrosive gas of 15/5 could be produced without extensively corrosion monitoring instrumented wells and flowlines. Based on the information available today, Alternative No. 1: L-80 carbon steel tubing combined with inhibitor injection downhole, is recommended. This is based on reported experience, which for Alt. No. still is scarce. (0 A lot of research and development work is now going on at steel mills, research institutes and oil companies, as well as field tests, looking.into sweet corrosion and erosion- corrosion problems, and the use of inhibitors and stainless steels. In phase of the 15/5 Engineering Study it is recommended that the different tubing materials are tested cOmprehensively in an environment simulating the actual conditions on 15/5. With the harsh conditions, especially if the chloride con- centrations is found to be high, it is not certain that L-80 tubing combined with downhole inhibitor injection is good( enough solution. The test program must therefore also include martensitic 13% Cr steels and ferritic-austenitic stainless steels. Where such tests should be conducted and to what extent, must be based on thourough investigation in the market updating field experience, research results and testing capacities. The existing performance data for both Alt. No. and No. materials is connected with so much uncertaincies, that tube failures due to corrosion, culd be expected before end of the field's production. design which allows the easiest method for repair and change of tubings, will therefore be preferable from materials point of view. This will favour the use of conventional platform versus subsea completion system. It is less troublesome, less complicated and much cheaper to inject inhibitors downhole from a. platform than through 20 km of pipeline to well below subsea unit. E.3.1.3 FlowlineS The transportation of the 15/5 gas with 4,4 mol % CO2 from a subsea unit, will cause sweet corrosion problems when the total pressure is over as little as 11 bar in the flowline. The gas will enter the flowline under pressure of 170 bar at start of production, and 70 bar at the end of production. The pressure at the processing platform is 50 bar. Therefore carbon steel line must be protected by continuous injection of inhibitors at the wellhead, or stainless steel line has to be chosen dependant on how agressive the transporte gas is and the flow rate. If stainless steel line are preferrable, the weldability of the materials and the corrosion resistance of the welded joints have to be evaluated. Flare system - Materials for Low Temperature Service If the platform alternative is selected flare system has to be included. Dependant on the lowest temperature in this system, carbon steel, nickel steel or stainless steel (ferritic-austenitic or austenitic) should be applied. The different types of steel are discussed in Appendix 5.E.3.2 SUBSEA RELIABILITY. COMPUTER AIDED ANALYSIS 4/1E.2.2.1 Introduction The reliability and availability of subsea production system is of vital interest. The reliability assessment may, however, be both time-consuming and complicated. It is therefore of interest to know if one can apply computer programs in the assessment work. For evaluation of the existing computer programs in reliability assessment, Norsk Hydro engaged SINTEF to review available pro- grams and apply some of them on reliability assessment of subsea production system. It is emphasized that the subsea production system used in this study is irrelevant to the system referred to elsewhere in this report.

The programs were applied. on fault trees for four alternative designs of subsea production system. System description The subsea production system consists of eight wells drilled through subsea template, each well connected to common production manifold. Two-phase-flow is assumed in the 20 km sales line. common kill and service line connect the process platform and kill and service manifold on the template. Also separate inhibitor injection lines to each X-mas tree is assumed. These lines are installed with the hydraulic supply in compo- site umbilical. The control and monitoring of the subsea system are accomplished through multiplex electrohydraulic control system. The communication and electrical power transfer, between the platform and the subsea installation, are accomplished through an electric cable. The four alternatives are due to different layout and .design of the control systems. Design alt. Design alt. : : Onesimple control pod for each well. Redundance and voting (2/3) for the control of each well. Design alt. : One centralized control pod designed with redundance and voting (2/3) for thu eight wells. Design alt. : One simple centralized control pod for the eight wells. As system failure following event was selected: Gas flow to platform equal or less than 50% of full production. With equal production from each of the eight wells, this means that the system is functioning when five or more wells are pro- ducing, and fails when only four or less are producing. , It was assumed that repair actions would normally not take place until the system had failed. An exception was done for few components which could be replaced by diver. Due to the system failure definition and repair philosophy it was practical to analyse for the top events, WELL FAILURE and COMMON EQUIPMENT FAILURE. E . . . Failure rates_ and repair times. _ Even under the most favourable conditions it is problem to obtain reliable failure and repair data for mechanical systems. For electrical and electronic systems the situation is lot better. For relatively new designs and concepts hardly any data exists at all. The failure data were therefore taken from ICI's and SRS' databook for similar equipment used in chemical plants. Repair times were our best guestimates.411E.3.2.6 Component Reliability For evaluation of the system availability the failure data and repair times are essential. Unfortunatelv,for components used in subsea production systems there are very few failure data readily available. Hollobone Hibbert & Associates Ltd. have in their Engineering Study 15/2 and 15/5 quoted some data for components like valves, chokes, etc., but only few figures are given, and for most components there is only qualitative discussion.

420,DISCOVERY_EVALUATION_REPORT,db015483bd0adb1d450b5422de4cd6b07474ae89,41,"the qualitative analysis might be the only possible approach to study the system. An important set of information is the minimum cut set, derived by qualitative analysis of fault tree. The minimum cut set is group of basic component failures or events whose occurences cause the top event to occur. listing of minimum cut sets tells you about the weakest link in the system. As can be seen from the list in appendix 4,.several computer programs which find minimal cut sets have been developed. When it comes to qualitative reliability analysis, both analytical and simulation techniques are used to find the reliability Characteristics. Normally the computer simulation techniques for reliability analysis is the Monte Carlo technique Analytical techniques include both Markow Process and Kinetic Tree Theory. E.3.2.3 Programs used in this rroject For the reliability analysis of subsea production system SINTEF made use of following computer programs: - MOCUS which obtains minimal cuts and/or minimal path sets from fault trees. - KITT-1 which calculates time dependent reliability characteristics for basic events, for minimum cut sets, and for the top event (the system failure of interest). The characteristics  calculated include: Unavailability, failure rate,. expected number of failures, and probability of one or more failures. (unreliability).IMPORTANCE which is used for .computing various measures of probabilistic importance of basic events and cut sets to fault tree. SAMPLE which uses Monte Carlo simulation to perform uncertainty analyses on the calculated reliability character- istics. The programs were applied. on fault trees for four alternative designs of subsea production system. System description The subsea production system consists of eight wells drilled through subsea template, each well connected to common production manifold. Two-phase-flow is assumed in the 20 km sales line. common kill and service line connect the process platform and kill and service manifold on the template. Also separate inhibitor injection lines to each X-mas tree is assumed. These lines are installed with the hydraulic supply in compo- site umbilical. The control and monitoring of the subsea system are accomplished through multiplex electrohydraulic control system. The communication and electrical power transfer, between the platform and the subsea installation, are accomplished through an electric cable. The four alternatives are due to different layout and .design of the control systems. Design alt. Design alt. : : Onesimple control pod for each well. Redundance and voting (2/3) for the control of each well. Design alt. : One centralized control pod designed with redundance and voting (2/3) for thu eight wells. Design alt. : One simple centralized control pod for the eight wells. As system failure following event was selected: Gas flow to platform equal or less than 50% of full production. With equal production from each of the eight wells, this means that the system is functioning when five or more wells are pro- ducing, and fails when only four or less are producing. , It was assumed that repair actions would normally not take place until the system had failed. An exception was done for few components which could be replaced by diver. Due to the system failure definition and repair philosophy it was practical to analyse for the top events, WELL FAILURE and COMMON EQUIPMENT FAILURE. E . . . Failure rates_ and repair times. _ Even under the most favourable conditions it is problem to obtain reliable failure and repair data for mechanical systems. For electrical and electronic systems the situation is lot better. For relatively new designs and concepts hardly any data exists at all. The failure data were therefore taken from ICI's and SRS' databook for similar equipment used in chemical plants. Repair times were our best guestimates.411E.3.2.6 Component Reliability For evaluation of the system availability the failure data and repair times are essential.

Cost and development for two jacket solutions, Scheme A and B, and one subsea production solution Scheme IIihave been considered by consultant and by partner according to technical assistant apointment. Based on this Hydro's estimate for capital cost, operating cost and field develop- ment for the three alternatives are as follow: Scheme I, Option Early production by drilling wells from semisubmersible and subsequent tie-back to fixed satellite platform. Total capital cost Annual operating cost Time to first production 483 mill. $ 45 mill. $ 4 years and months. Conventional production by drilling wells from fixed satellite platform.

Scheme II Subsea production by drilling wells from semi-submersible and completion on subsea manifold. Total capital cost - 372 mill. $ Annual operating cost - 35 mill. $ Time to first production - years and months. The cost estimates for the two jacket solutions are in general less uncertain than the cost estimates for the subsea cluster, which represent quite lot of new and advanced technology. Though the subsea production alternativ, Scheme II, represent a significant lower total capital cost, this option seems less attractiv due to the use of new and advanced technology on a number of areas, and also problems concerning corrosion and hydration in the pipeline, and inspection and maintenance of the subsea equipment which might result in poor regularity of the field. Because possible problems may occur during alignment of the tie-back operation, Scheme Option A, the conclusion of today is to go for the conventional jacket alternative 'Scheme Option B. But, by the time, probably in the beginning of the 1990's when the 15/5 field will be developed, the alignment problems during tie-back operation to the jacket have probably been solved in proper manner. If so, this alternative seems to be the best because it can start production about one year earlier than the conventional jacket alternative and results in about the same total capital cost.

Cost and development for two jacket solutions, Scheme A and B, and one subsea production solution Scheme IIihave been considered by consultant and by partner according to technical assistant apointment. Based on this Hydro's estimate for capital cost, operating cost and field develop- ment for the three alternatives are as follow: Scheme I, Option Early production by drilling wells from semisubmersible and subsequent tie-back to fixed satellite platform. Total capital cost Annual operating cost Time to first production 483 mill. $ 45 mill. $ 4 years and months. Conventional production by drilling wells from fixed satellite platform. Total captal cost 467 mill. Annual operating cost - 45 mill. $ Time to first production years and months. Scheme II Subsea production by drilling wells from semi-submersible and completion on subsea manifold. Total capital cost - 372 mill. $ Annual operating cost - 35 mill. $ Time to first production - years and months. The cost estimates for the two jacket solutions are in general less uncertain than the cost estimates for the subsea cluster, which represent quite lot of new and advanced technology. Though the subsea production alternativ, Scheme II, represent a significant lower total capital cost, this option seems less attractiv due to the use of new and advanced technology on a number of areas, and also problems concerning corrosion and hydration in the pipeline, and inspection and maintenance of the subsea equipment which might result in poor regularity of the field. Because possible problems may occur during alignment of the tie-back operation, Scheme Option A, the conclusion of today is to go for the conventional jacket alternative 'Scheme Option B. But, by the time, probably in the beginning of the 1990's when the 15/5 field will be developed, the alignment problems during tie-back operation to the jacket have probably been solved in proper manner. If so, this alternative seems to be the best because it can start production about one year earlier than the conventional jacket alternative and results in about the same total capital cost.

See table F-1. The costestimates for the two jacket solutions include cost for two sales pipelines from the jacket to the central plat- form on the Sleipner field. This correspond to the technical conclusion of having two eperate sales pipelines - one for gas and one for condensate. Technically both alternatives involve no new technology as far as the platform is concerned. The main area where problems may occur is alignment during the option A,tie-hack operation.

Scheme II (subsea production) is estimated to cost 372 mill. and represents significant lower cost than the two jacket alternatives, see table F-1. Technical the subsea production option necessitates the use of advanced technology in several areas and the development of new designs and techniques.

F.1.4 COST SENSITIVITY APPRAISAL Table F-3 summarizes the principal cost centres for Schemes and II. In the column to the right of the capital cost of each cost centre for each Scheme, is ths percentage which represents the upper range of cost, allowing for over- spend. In general, it can be seen that the upper range per- cent assessments for the subsea alternative, Scheme II, are significantly higher than the platform options. This reflects the higher technical risks assosiated with such development when compared with conventional solutions. To the right of each upper range percent column is the resulting estimated value of possible overspend. This is shown as an increment ot be added to the original estimates to obtain the upper range cost total for each Scheme. It can be seen that the possible total overspend increments for each Scheme are of similar order, ranging form 83 million $ to 89 million On the basis of this assessment, the value ofTable F-2 Operating Cost Comparison (in mill.

C) The estimated bar chart programs differs to some extend from the consultans proposal:- Some operations could be increased and go on simul- taneous with other activities. - Other operations could start later, thus capital is tied up at later stage. - Debugging and long test periods are required for some operations. - Increase to certain extend the commissioning and testing period.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What is the estimated cost for Scheme IA (tie-back) of wellbore 15/5-1?,483 mill. $,The estimated cost for Scheme IA (tie-back) of wellbore 15/5-1 is 483 million dollars.,1

See table F-1. The costestimates for the two jacket solutions include cost for two sales pipelines from the jacket to the central plat- form on the Sleipner field. This correspond to the technical conclusion of having two eperate sales pipelines - one for gas and one for condensate. Technically both alternatives involve no new technology as far as the platform is concerned. The main area where problems may occur is alignment during the option A,tie-hack operation. But by the time the field is developed experience will have been gained on similar operations in the Gulf of Mexico, off Indonesia and to certain extend in the North Sea. Scheme II (subsea production) is estimated to cost 372 mill. and represents significant lower cost than the two jacket alternatives, see table F-1. Technical the subsea production option necessitates the use of advanced technology in several areas and the development of new designs and techniques. Hence the cost estimates for this alternative are loaded with high uncertainty figures.111 F.1.3 OPERATING COST COMPARISON Table F-2 shows that annual operating costs for the jacket alternatives are estimated to be 45 mill. $ and 35 mill. $ for the subsea production option. Considering the use of unproven advanced and new technology for the subsea production option, this could easily result in more unexpected workover and maintenance costs than pro- posed. Operating costs for the fixed platform alternatives are believed to be more certain estimates because they are based on statistical data from existing platforms of the same type. Figu::e F-1 shows cumulative expences related to common date for first production. The cash flow figures include capital cost, operating costicontingency, management and insurance. F.1.4 COST SENSITIVITY APPRAISAL Table F-3 summarizes the principal cost centres for Schemes and II. In the column to the right of the capital cost of each cost centre for each Scheme, is ths percentage which represents the upper range of cost, allowing for over- spend. In general, it can be seen that the upper range per- cent assessments for the subsea alternative, Scheme II, are significantly higher than the platform options. This reflects the higher technical risks assosiated with such development when compared with conventional solutions. To the right of each upper range percent column is the resulting estimated value of possible overspend. This is shown as an increment ot be added to the original estimates to obtain the upper range cost total for each Scheme. It can be seen that the possible total overspend increments for each Scheme are of similar order, ranging form 83 million $ to 89 million On the basis of this assessment, the value ofTable F-2 Operating Cost Comparison (in mill.

The Utsira High to the east has been positive feature since the Viking Trough was outlined in the Permian time, and was not completely submerged until Upper Cretaceous time. Throughout this time and particularily in the Lower and Middle Jurassic, the Utsira High has been substantial source of clastic sediments being washed into the basin to the west. The Fladen Ground Spur to the west, was not major source area until Oxfordian/Callovian time after having been uplifted in the late Bathonian. Sediments from the west have not had any major influence in the eastern part of the 15/5 block, since the depocenter throughout Jurassic time lay to the west. Permian salt may have moved from early Upper Cretaceous time onward when the overburden became sufficient to initiate salt movement. Diapirism is not major structural element in this area, but may have modified the structural shape of the 15/5-1 structure at very late time. Structural evolution Since Triassic the 15/5 area has been affected by basin floor movements of great structural complexity. These structural movements generally can be described as continous basin subsidence with shorter breaks of uplift, faulting, tilting and even folding. Superimposed and perhaps in association therewith there has been number of eustatic sealevel changes. At Bunter time the Viking trough was established. The 4644 , Lewe-r Jurassic was time of sediment infill in the central part of the subsiding Trougli, and sediments did onlap theflanks of the basin and did probably not reach the high 15/5-1 structure. During Bajocian the tectonic stability was disturbed by volcanic updoming in the triple junction province further to the south. VIE, 64.4- (An% (o'h So ate-. The end Bathonian was another time of tectonic instability that more directly affected the 15/5-1 area with local and regional uplift of the landsurface and creation and reactivation of faults in predominantly N-S direction. (Figure 111.1). During Callovian the 15/5-1 area was stable. To the west the basin subsided more rapidly. At end Callovian time tectonic pulse might have occurred with possible further splitting and movements of the fault blocks. In Oxfordian the basin continued to subside and the 15/5-1 area was elevated The Utsira High to the east remained positive feature, but became less important as sediment source. The Fladen Ground Spur to the west was tectonically active and became the main source of sediments filling in the Viking Trough. (Figure 111.2). The Kimmeridgian was marked by another pulse of faulting and thrusting although of minor importance to the 15/5-1 structure. (Figure 111.3). During Lowex Cretaceous the 15/5-1 was affected by the strongest relative vertical movement due to uplift of the Sleipner area in combination with continous basinal subsidence to the west. Deformation occured by flexure rather than faulting at this time (FigureIII.4). Permian salt is believed to have started to move in early 4Ar Cretaceous time and continued until Early Tertiary. (Figure 111.5).Stratigraphy and environment of deposition During the Lower Jurassic, the positive Sleipner structure aerial received sediments of subareal nature. In places these beds were eroded and Middle Jurassic sediments are resting on beds of Triassic age. In Bajocian, conditions changed. The volcanic updoming related to the triple junction to the south, influenced sedimentation in the 15 quadrant. Erosional products from the volcanic province and the Utsira High were inter- mixed and transported in northward direction. During Bajocian, the sealevel raised and the environment of deposition changed from braided stream continental- paralic to deltaic/paralic shallow marine.

The Utsira High to the east has been positive feature since the Viking Trough was outlined in the Permian time, and was not completely submerged until Upper Cretaceous time. Throughout this time and particularily in the Lower and Middle Jurassic, the Utsira High has been substantial source of clastic sediments being washed into the basin to the west. The Fladen Ground Spur to the west, was not major source area until Oxfordian/Callovian time after having been uplifted in the late Bathonian. Sediments from the west have not had any major influence in the eastern part of the 15/5 block, since the depocenter throughout Jurassic time lay to the west. Permian salt may have moved from early Upper Cretaceous time onward when the overburden became sufficient to initiate salt movement. Diapirism is not major structural element in this area, but may have modified the structural shape of the 15/5-1 structure at very late time. Structural evolution Since Triassic the 15/5 area has been affected by basin floor movements of great structural complexity. These structural movements generally can be described as continous basin subsidence with shorter breaks of uplift, faulting, tilting and even folding. Superimposed and perhaps in association therewith there has been number of eustatic sealevel changes. At Bunter time the Viking trough was established. The 4644 , Lewe-r Jurassic was time of sediment infill in the central part of the subsiding Trougli, and sediments did onlap theflanks of the basin and did probably not reach the high 15/5-1 structure. During Bajocian the tectonic stability was disturbed by volcanic updoming in the triple junction province further to the south. VIE, 64.4- (An% (o'h So ate-. The end Bathonian was another time of tectonic instability that more directly affected the 15/5-1 area with local and regional uplift of the landsurface and creation and reactivation of faults in predominantly N-S direction. (Figure 111.1). During Callovian the 15/5-1 area was stable. To the west the basin subsided more rapidly. At end Callovian time tectonic pulse might have occurred with possible further splitting and movements of the fault blocks. In Oxfordian the basin continued to subside and the 15/5-1 area was elevated The Utsira High to the east remained positive feature, but became less important as sediment source. The Fladen Ground Spur to the west was tectonically active and became the main source of sediments filling in the Viking Trough. (Figure 111.2). The Kimmeridgian was marked by another pulse of faulting and thrusting although of minor importance to the 15/5-1 structure. (Figure 111.3). During Lowex Cretaceous the 15/5-1 was affected by the strongest relative vertical movement due to uplift of the Sleipner area in combination with continous basinal subsidence to the west. Deformation occured by flexure rather than faulting at this time (FigureIII.4). Permian salt is believed to have started to move in early 4Ar Cretaceous time and continued until Early Tertiary. (Figure 111.5).Stratigraphy and environment of deposition During the Lower Jurassic, the positive Sleipner structure aerial received sediments of subareal nature. In places these beds were eroded and Middle Jurassic sediments are resting on beds of Triassic age. In Bajocian, conditions changed. The volcanic updoming related to the triple junction to the south, influenced sedimentation in the 15 quadrant. Erosional products from the volcanic province and the Utsira High were inter- mixed and transported in northward direction. During Bajocian, the sealevel raised and the environment of deposition changed from braided stream continental- paralic to deltaic/paralic shallow marine. The end of Bajocian was marked by temporary marine lowstand and deposition of extensive coalbeds took place in an inter- distributary bay/marsh environment.",15/5-1,Norsk Hydro a.s.,1998,What is the target date to complete the final report for the 15/5-1 well?,April 1979,The target date to complete the final report for the 15/5-1 well is April 1979.,1

The core porosity is on average porosity units higher than the log porosity. The difference is due to the overburden effect which tends to reduce the porosity in reservoir conditions (as confirmed by labora- tory tests). The average water saturation from logs (14%) is in good agreement with the capillary irreducible water saturation (11-16%). The lower permeability values in general come from the lower pay zone (zone no. 4).IV.3. WELL PRODUCTIVITY IV.3.1 Test results A summary of the DST results is given in table IV.1.

The Kimmerian Unconformity is reasonably good marker in the 15/5 block, but deteriorates eastwards into the 15/6 block. The top of the reservoir is not mappable from the present data. The base of the reservoir, however, is tied to the Red Marker (Top of Bajocian deltaics). It is reasonable good reflector on the north and west flank of the 15/5-1 structure, but gets discontinuous climbing up on the high. Migration of the map is done manually by using the unmigrated map and calculating the migration effect on dipline. This effect as function of the dip is then applied on the whole map. The method is not accurate, but gives the order of magni- tude of the migration effect. The area of closure is reduced by approximately 20% by applying this method.- Preliminary velocity data (final velocity data is not yet available) from 15/5-1 and velocity data from 15/6-2 down to the Kimmerian Unconformity have been used to construct the geological cross sections in depth which are used for the reservoir model. Reservoirs of-15/5-1 deposit The hydrocarbon reservoir sediments in the 15/5-1 are formed by sands of Bajocian to Callovian age. The particular 15/5-1 Jurassic reservoir sands can be split into two units, one lower coal-bearing sand of Bajocian age representing prograding deltaic sequence with delta plain/marsh sequence marking the top of the unit. The base of this unit is more question- able as one might speculate if the delta is resting on Lower Jurassic or Triassic or perhaps even sediments of the Middle Jurassic Pentland Formation type (red to green silt and shales). The second and upper sand unit on top of the deltaics represents transgressive period and consists of shore- line deposits of Bathonian to Callovian age. Because of continous reworking of these later sands, age-dating is difficult as the 15/5-1 well penetrated Callovian sediments which were to large extent reworked Batilonian. Geometry of reservoir As mentioned transgressive sequence of sediments is deposited due to sea level rise from the west over the Sleipner area and onlapping the Utsira High to the east. The geometry and closure of these reservoir sands is not clear. Two possible models are considered: A. The sand is onlarping eastwards across the axis of the 15/5-1 and 15/6-2 structure, and the crest of the 15/5-1 structure was hingeline during deposition, and east of this line the sand has an even thickness, while to the west it is thickening down flank. The closure is in this case defined by the structural closure as mapped today. This is the model on which we have based our reserve estimate:. B. One could however imagine pinchout (onlap) situation along the hingeline of the 15/5-1 structure extending northeast and 'outhward into the 15/6 block. Applying this alternative model, the 15/5-1 deposit may not be defined by the structural closure as mapped today. A westward thickening of the reservoir and possible shaleout in the basin could make stratigraphic trap of considerable size. Further geological and geo- physical study will be made to evaluate this concept. IV PETROPHYSICS AND WELL PRODUCTIVITY IV. 1.

From 4330m to 4799m the section consists predominently of shale with thin limestone or calcareous sandstone beds. Some of these have porosity, the most porous of which are at 4591m to 4591.75m and4620.25m to 4621.25m with porosities of 11%. The section from 4799m to T.D. consists of sands and shales. The sands occur from 4799m to 4886m (87m gross) with 16m of the sand with porosities between and 19% (average 10.1%). Sidewall cores recovered from these sands consisted of dark brown grey very fine grained silty argillaceous sands with poor visible porosity. Separation of the Dll and Mll curves suggests that effective porosity only exists from 4799m to 4829.5m (9m net). No fluorescence was observed in the rock cuttings but in two sidewall cores at 4832m and 4885.5m traces of slow streaming cut were observed. When drilled, the porous zones were associated with an increase in gas from the mud. Methane constituted more than 90% of the gas recorded from the gas chromatograph. Water saturation calculations were mage using an Rw of ohm-m (equivalent to 70,000'ppm NaCl at 290 F) which is similar to that known to exist in the Brae and Beryl areas. All the porous intervals were indicated by the logs to contain hydrocarbons. Water saturations in the above calcareous intervals (4591-4621.25m) range from 21% to 31%. Water saturations in the sands from 4799m to 4886m range from 27% to 55%. From the data available it is impossible to conclude the type of fluid in the reservoir. F.I.T.s were run over three zones but were dogged by mechanical failure and by failure to seal against the formation. F.I.T.s at 4815.5m and 4816m in zone with 14% porosity had very low flowing pressures (187-221 psi) and no pressure build-up in the time allowed indicating that the sands have very low permeability.

From 4330m to 4799m the section consists predominently of shale with thin limestone or calcareous sandstone beds. Some of these have porosity, the most porous of which are at 4591m to 4591.75m and4620.25m to 4621.25m with porosities of 11%. The section from 4799m to T.D. consists of sands and shales. The sands occur from 4799m to 4886m (87m gross) with 16m of the sand with porosities between and 19% (average 10.1%). Sidewall cores recovered from these sands consisted of dark brown grey very fine grained silty argillaceous sands with poor visible porosity. Separation of the Dll and Mll curves suggests that effective porosity only exists from 4799m to 4829.5m (9m net). No fluorescence was observed in the rock cuttings but in two sidewall cores at 4832m and 4885.5m traces of slow streaming cut were observed. When drilled, the porous zones were associated with an increase in gas from the mud. Methane constituted more than 90% of the gas recorded from the gas chromatograph. Water saturation calculations were mage using an Rw of ohm-m (equivalent to 70,000'ppm NaCl at 290 F) which is similar to that known to exist in the Brae and Beryl areas. All the porous intervals were indicated by the logs to contain hydrocarbons. Water saturations in the above calcareous intervals (4591-4621.25m) range from 21% to 31%. Water saturations in the sands from 4799m to 4886m range from 27% to 55%. From the data available it is impossible to conclude the type of fluid in the reservoir. F.I.T.s were run over three zones but were dogged by mechanical failure and by failure to seal against the formation. F.I.T.s at 4815.5m and 4816m in zone with 14% porosity had very low flowing pressures (187-221 psi) and no pressure build-up in the time allowed indicating that the sands have very low permeability.

From 4330m to 4799m the section consists predominently of shale with thin limestone or calcareous sandstone beds. Some of these have porosity, the most porous of which are at 4591m to 4591.75m and4620.25m to 4621.25m with porosities of 11%. The section from 4799m to T.D. consists of sands and shales. The sands occur from 4799m to 4886m (87m gross) with 16m of the sand with porosities between and 19% (average 10.1%). Sidewall cores recovered from these sands consisted of dark brown grey very fine grained silty argillaceous sands with poor visible porosity. Separation of the Dll and Mll curves suggests that effective porosity only exists from 4799m to 4829.5m (9m net). No fluorescence was observed in the rock cuttings but in two sidewall cores at 4832m and 4885.5m traces of slow streaming cut were observed. When drilled, the porous zones were associated with an increase in gas from the mud. Methane constituted more than 90% of the gas recorded from the gas chromatograph. Water saturation calculations were mage using an Rw of ohm-m (equivalent to 70,000'ppm NaCl at 290 F) which is similar to that known to exist in the Brae and Beryl areas. All the porous intervals were indicated by the logs to contain hydrocarbons. Water saturations in the above calcareous intervals (4591-4621.25m) range from 21% to 31%. Water saturations in the sands from 4799m to 4886m range from 27% to 55%. From the data available it is impossible to conclude the type of fluid in the reservoir. F.I.T.s were run over three zones but were dogged by mechanical failure and by failure to seal against the formation. F.I.T.s at 4815.5m and 4816m in zone with 14% porosity had very low flowing pressures (187-221 psi) and no pressure build-up in the time allowed indicating that the sands have very low permeability. Only mud was recovered. G. W. Cooper.
