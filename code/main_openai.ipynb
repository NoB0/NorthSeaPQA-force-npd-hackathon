Section 1.1.5 deals with the alternatives that exist and from this superficial examination, it is probable that the single leg jack-up concept, with pre-commissioned topside equipment installed over predrilled template would be comparable in cost. a. Influence of Method of Installation Barge launching the structure on location is the conventional method of installation, followed by controlled flooding to up- right the structure and final sinking to the seabed. If such a method is adopted, at least one face of the structure must have two parallel lauch tracks, and strong launch truss must be incorporated internally. This implies that at least legs must be used arranged in two rows of 4. The major disadvantage of such an eight-leg structure is that the wave force attracted are larger than for more open four legged structure . This is only true, however, if provision for installation is not considered and for heavier structures. The conventional North Sea approach has been to build large self-floating legs, which attract considerable extra wave force, (e.g. Thistle, Ninian, Magnus) or fabricate purpose built floa- taion rafts, which can be submerged with the structure atta- ched (e.g. Froties). The Forties system is not now favoured because of the lack of resuability of the floatation rafts and in each case, considerable extra problems of fabrication are introduced. The most complex and time consuming fabrication for self-floating jackets is for the floatation legs on the ground,,and this must be substantially complete before the main jacket structure can be built. This.complicatps and extends the fabrication process. A four legged structure without provision for installation will generally weight less because of the reduced wave forces and more open structure. It is not as redundant as an eight legged'\n",

INITIAL RESERVOIR CONDITIONS 7.1 Initial pressure Recording of static reservoir pressure has been attempted during the various test and sampling operations, see table and fig. 6.

At the WOC (-3167.6m BSL) static pressure will be: ps = bars The gradient in the water zone, based on two points only, will be: 1.99 bar/10 This is improbably high.

The thermal gradient for the test data best straight line is also C/100 m, which is taken as confirmation of the result for the gradient.

CONSIDERATIONS ON POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT The evaluation of development concept of the 18/10 discovery is governed by three essential parameters: - the amount of recoverable reserves - the well productivity - the expected natural flowing life of the wells The reference to existing marginal fields in production (Argyll, Auk, Buchan), in conjunction with an extrapolation of the Ekofisk early production scheme, shows that the recoverable reserves-treshold for marginaly economical development, by mean of light development scheme, is about Million tons.- - The median (and even the maximum) reserves of the 18/10-1 discovery are far below this limit. In fact, the location of the development wells (3 on the main accumulation and in the relinguished area), the low well productivity comingled with an absolute need for lifting, do not allow to envisage such light type development. Therefore only classical development scheme could be considered which requires much higher level of reserves to be economical, which level cannot exist in this discovery.', 'Passage_id': 103}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 18/10-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It so appears that it is economically impossible to foresee any development of such discovery.

Since Norsk Hydro 's first interpretation of this feature (15/5-1 Development Concept Study July 1979), investigations into the stratigraphy and sedimentology have continued as result of the recommendation of partners in the 048 licence. At that time (1979) it was believed that better understanding of the Dagny feature, would result from more detailed appraisal of the Greater Sleipner area. Consequently, Norsk Hydro initiated two independent appraisals of the Greater Sleipner area: one in Norsk Hydro's office, the other at Robertson Research laboratories in North Wales. The purpose of this report is to present the models resulting from these studies, and compare them together with the earlier report, with special emphasis on the Dagny feature.\", 'Passage_id': 215}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: B1.2 Summary B1.2.1 Geological Setting Our interpretation of the regional tectonic framework is unchanged from the earlier report, but there is considerable change in the interpretation of paleogeography and depositional environments. Envisaged, is Middle Jurassic delta plain draping the Triassic basin floor with fluvial deposits: channel sands, overbank alluvial deposits, coal and swamp measures. Seliment sources include the area to the south, and the higher flanks of the graben. Primary drainage was northwards along the graben axis.- - Gradually increasing graben subsidence towards the end of the Middle Jurassic, resulted in shallow marine transgression from the north, the dominant sediment deposited was essentially shale. In the youngest deposits however, and .especially those of the marginal coastal regions, sands were deposited in parallic environment consisting of destructive and constructive prograding sandy deltas, the primary deposits of which were frequently reworked on the advancing shallow marine, near-shore shelf.', 'Passage_id': 216}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Intercalated bay, lagoon and back barrier deposits are also partly preserved. During the upper Jurassic (Callovian to Oxfordian), grabenal tectonics matured with uneven and possibly oscillatory subsidence due to accompanying salt movements. This complicated the present day sand distribution by partially eroding the crests of contemporaneous highs in the late Callovian and Oxfordian stages. B1.2.2 Depositional Model', 'Passage_id': 217}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The Dagny reservoir is contained in part of locally extensive, fairly uniform sheet marine sandstone, which lay offshore from delta-front complex to the south. The delta front is seen in 15/9-2 where it consists of prograding distributary mouth bars and fans, intercalated with coastal marine sediments. From the delta front northwards, transition of facies is found. Shoreface deposits (15/9-1), pass into prodelta, and eventually marine shales (15/6-5). The sheet sand facies of the Dagny feature are then encountered in 15/6-3, 2, and 15/5-1, but eventually shale out into the offshore marine facies found in 15/5-2.', 'Passage_id': 218}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: These may be relict sands consisting of reworked coastal deposits of an earlier shoreline/deliya front position. Within this model, it is possible to explain facies variations by prograding deposition or dipwards diachroneity. Several correlations of the shallow marine shelf facies and the shoreface to delta front facies are possible. B1.3 Conclusions The Dagny reservoir formation is clearly related to the equivalent Jurassic reservoirs in 15/6-2, 15/6-3, 15/6-4 and .15/6-5; the relationship with the more southerly Sleipner wells, 15/9-1 and 15/9-2, is less clear. equivalent sheet marine sandstone.', 'Passage_id': 219}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In the Greater Sleipner Area, two distinct reservoir fades are defined: a) bioturbated, argillaceous sandstones with good to poor reservoir characteristics and b) non-bioturbated, cross-bedded clean sandstone of good to excellent reservoir characteristics. Within these groups ten sub-fades may be delimited. A third group of non-reservoir facies 'comprise further six sub-types, which include coals, marine and non-marine shales, and siltstones . The shallow marine sheet sandstone in which the Dagny reservoir occurs, comprises sub-facies of both types and 'above, and amounts to consistently fair to good quality reservoir of considerable extent. The Dagny reservoir, however, is limited by both tectonic and stratigraphic controls.\", 'Passage_id': 220}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Crestal erosion to the south - east of 15/5-1 can be expected to significantly reduce the reservoir. Although there is possibility of some slig4 thickening downflank depending on the extent of crestal erosion, downflank thinning will occur northwards towards the eventual shale-out between 15/5-1 and 15/5-2.Bl. Database The database has been improved by the addition of wells Sampling from cores has been increased for the Robertson Research report, and in addition to further conventional core  descriptions and paleontological studies, samples have been specially prepared for palynofacies analysis in an attempt to give greater certainty to the interpreted environments of deposition.

Separation of this interval from the underlying Triassic is complicated by the sparsity of forms in the vicinity of the boundary. In most cases, this must be established by other means, but significant unconformity is evidenced by the marked absence of Lower Jurassic beds.

The early Callovian is particularly enriched compared to the middle-late Callovian, and it is becoming easier to distinguish this as formal sub-division, particularly as the early Callovian appears to coincide with the lower, cleaner sand cycles in the Brent equivalent/Reservoir Formation, and the middle-late Callovian appears to coincide with the increasingly ihaley upper part, grading into the Heather Formation.

Occasionally the unconformity may be seen on dipmeter logs. The upper contact with the overlying reservoir formation is cored and easily _recognisable; it is considered to be disconformity.

These variations have led to the working hypothesis, that the 15/9-1 and 9-2 sands are genetically separate and possibly younger than the others to the north, and the proposal that the upper parts at least are time equivalent to the overlying Heather Formation.

In the south however, it appears to be the lateral equivalent of the upper part of the reservoir formation, with an intercalated transition zone between 15/6-5 and 15/9-1. The thickness of Heather Formation north of 15/9-1 varies markedly, depending on closeness to the main highs.

B1.6 Sedimentology The sedimentological interpretation of the Heather and Sleipner Formations remains unchanged from the earlier report: that is, that the Heather Formation is quiet water, marine shale, and that the Sleipner Formation represents non-marine delta plain.', 'Passage_id': 232}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: This agrees with the Robertson Research interpretation which accompanies this report (Appendix 6) In this section therefore, we confine ourselves to the reservoir formation. Robertson Research and Norsk Hydro, have each adopted different approach to the description of sedimentary facies. Having described each of the wells, Robertson Research have found that broadly similar lithologic facies occur in three seperate groups which coincide with tripartite grouping of the wells. This division then forms the basis of their depostional model.', 'Passage_id': 233}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: full description of these groups is given in Appendix 6; however, they can be summarised as follows: Group 1: 15/5-2 - The Callovian reservoir sands are entirely absent in this well; the time correlative interval being represented by continuous succession of quiet water, open marine shales. lithology of these wells is fairly consistent, compacted column of mainly very fine grained, argillaceous, micaceous and carbonaceous sands. These are locally pebbly, and characterised by cross bedding, ripples, scoured bases, bioturbation and burrowing. Fairly abandant macro and micro fauna confirm marine environment of deposition.', 'Passage_id': 234}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In their opinion, the lack of significant shale intercallations highlight the long term continuity of depositional currents, the uniformity of the sand indicating variations to be gradual. This is interpreted as evidence of long term shelf currents below wave base, since the more variable, higher energy deposition above wave base, would be unlikely to produce such significant accumulations. In such an environment, storm surge, and sand wave deposits might be expected, as would lateral transitions into marine shales in any direction. Group 3: 15/9-1. In contrast to the two former groups, the reservoir interval is characterised by markedly dissimilar intercalated lithologies.', 'Passage_id': 235}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Interbedded shales, claystones, siltstones and sandstones have both sharp and gradational contacts, and wide variety of bedforms are noted. Most of the interval is burrowed or bioturbated to some degree, with marine conditions determined paleontologically. From these observations and the abundance of transitional prograding sandy units with sharply terminated upper contacts, it can be concluded that the range of depositional energies was significantly greater than in the former two groups and of more inconsistent duration. Robertson Research interpret these factors to indicate shallow marine environment above wave base, where the interplay of wave and tidal currents would produce complex facies variations. In addition, in shallow water conditions minor fluctuations in sea level would have more significant impact on depositional patterns than in the deeper environments envisaged for Groups & 2.', 'Passage_id': 236}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In contrast to this interpretive approach, Norsk Hydro'sfmore recent work ,has employed the term facies in more descriptive sense. The original facies groups described in the first report were abandoned in favour of three groups, which, it is hoped, will be of grater assistence not only in more accurate rock description, but also in reservoir simulation. Figs. B2, 3, and describe these groups; they may be summarised as follows:- 10 -  Fades Group 1: Bioturbated, low energy sandstones and sandy or 8ilty-mudstones. The group comprises four sub-facies ranging from fairly clean, finely burrowed sands, to intensely bioturbated siltstones and silty mudstones.

Since wave activity would obliterate burrows and restrict burrowing organisms, the high amount of burrowing and bioturbation is interpreted as indicative of low energy area below normal wave base. Furthermore, the frequent occurrence of short cycles is taken to indicate either periodic storms and/or the migration of sand waves with intervening muddy troughs. This facies has moderate to poor reservoir quality resulting from the high amounts of primary argillaceous material, and is readily identifiable on E-logs by the bell and funnel gamma log motifs.

Group facies is almost entirely absent from 15/9-2. Facies Group II: This comprises clean, non-bioturbated, moderate to high energy ripple and cross-bedded sandstones and pebble beds consisting of six sub-facies. These range from the coarsest pebble/conglomerates with high-angle cross-bedding and rip-up clasts, to the finest, well sorted plane and low angle cross-bedded/laminated sands.', 'Passage_id': 239}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The variety of depositional environments of the six sub-facies is considerable, but in Sleipner this is confined to deltaic distributary channels, delta front fans, coastal shoal sands in either estuarine or bay areas, and sand waves or ripples inS. the shoreface, and shallow marine sheets. The lack of argillaceous material, burrowing or bioturbation, is taken to be evidence of sustained high energy deposition generated by currents and/or waves, depending on the location. 'The group is largely absent in 15/9-1, which appears to divide the area into north and south provinces. North of 15/9-1 Group II facies occurs in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3 and 15/6-5, as mainly fine grained deposits with low to moderate angle current cross bedding, with some ripples, and evidence of occasional multidirectional current or wave energy. South of 15/9-1 in 15/9:2, Group II facies are notably coarser, with thick lenses of high angle, unidirectional cross bedded sands, separated by thin intercalations of finer, more moderately cross bedded, sands with multidirectional and ripple cross beds.\", 'Passage_id': 240}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The southern area is 'interpreted as sequence of rapidly influxed delta front fans deposited in shallow marine/coastal environment.

Fig. B6 is sketch map which shows the occurrence of these facies in four zones. It is apparent that these coincide roughly with the three Robertson Research zones. B1.7.1', 'Passage_id': 243}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Depositional Models From the preceeding section it is apparent that both Norsk Hydro and Robertson Research have broadly similar interpretations of sedimentology and depositional environments, particularly of the Dagny. However, the differences which exist, plus the various possible well correlations, leads to number of different model possibilities. In particular, several interpretations are possible when: correlating the Dagny - 15/6 sheet sands with the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 sands correlating the biostratigrqphic uncertainties of age of these sands relating the Heather Shales to the reservoir sands, when in Dagny the Heather is very thin, yet in 15/6-5 it is very thick, and appears to be time equivalent of the sands in 15/9-1. Furthermore, within the reservoir interval, correlative horizons are rare. In the earlier report, it was suggested that the tight ankerite horizon in the lower part of thef reservoir (particularly prominent in 15/5-1, 15/6-2, 15/6-3, and 15/6-5) be used as correlative datum.', 'Passage_id': 244}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: However, the now  generally accepted view that this is diagenetic feature leads us to doubt the justification of this. More recent attempts to correlate the various coal seams also appears to be hazardous in view of the palynofacies analysis which seemingly confirms drifted origin for all the coals above the Sleipner Formation.- 13 - From this it is apparent that correlating the reservoir depends largely on interpretation of facies relationships. Three models are presented, based on the following assumptions: That the underlying Sleipner Formation comprises in-situ delta deposits, the top of which is disconformity, and time synchronous datum. That the overlying Reservoir and Heather Formations were deposited in marine environment, resulting from southwards transgression along the Viking graben at the end of the Middle Jurassic. Model I: This is the model proposed by Robertson Research (Fig. 88) which defines three time equivalent zones of different depositional environment: 1. distal open marine shale facies in the North.', 'Passage_id': 245}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 2. central region of marine shelf, sheet sandstones, largely current deposited with occasional storm-surge influxes. 3. nearshore, coastal facies in the south, consisting of intercallated sandstones and shales. Finer details are given in Appendix 6. Model II: This model (Fig. B9) was designed by Norsk Hydro in early 1980 as an attempt to explain some of the facies relationships between the Dagny - 15/6 sheet sand and the shoreface-delta front deposits seen in 15/9-1 and 15/9-2.- 14 - From sedimentological, paleontological, and log correlation studies, the Dagny deposit was established to be related to the 15/6 sands, but considerable differences existed between these and the significantly thicker deposits to the south.', 'Passage_id': 246}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It was felt that the uniformity of the Dagny - 15/6 sands would be less likely to give new information than detailed study of 15/9-1 and 15/9-2, where superficial observations showed some interesting depositional patterns. Consequently, Model II evolved out of detailed investigation of these two wells (159-1 and 15/9-2). The prograding vertical sequences seen on logs and in the cores of 15/9-1, were equated to shallowing/deepening sequences of facies in 15/9-2 in an attempt to define cycles of deposition; the following three cycles emerge: Cycle III: An extensive lense-like sheet of intermixed shallow marine, shoreface deposits stretching from north of 15/5-1 to 15/9-2 in the south. In the north these sands shale out into deeper marine shales whereas in the south they thin between over and underlying coal seams, indicating closeness to shoreline. This represents the earliest phase of sand deposition resulting from an initial marine transgressive push southwards.', 'Passage_id': 247}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The cycle consists primarly of Facies Group II sands (as defined by Norsk Hydro), with intercalated horizons of Facies Group I. The thickness of sand in the central area (15/6-3 - 15/5-1) may result from sustained reworking of coastal deposits and small shifts in transgressive-regressive shorelines. Cycle III sands comprise all of the reservoir formation deposition in 15/5-2 is deep water marine shale. Dagny may thus be described as Cycle III reservoir.- 15 - Cycle II: Sands of cycle II are found only in 15/9-1 and 15/9-2. Time equivalent deposits are represented in 15/6-5 and possibly 15/6-3 and 15/6-2, by Heather Shales.', 'Passage_id': 248}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: This pattern was initiated by rise in sea level which pushed the shoreline further south than during Cycle III deposition, submerging Cycle III sands throughout the area. As the centre of sand deposition migrated southwards, corresponding offshore shale was then deposited over the 15/6 area in the form of the Heather Shale Formation. Continuous sand deposition is evidenced in 15/9-2, while 15/9-1 with its -vertical sequence of intercalated sands, silts and silty mudstones, reflects transition zone lying between the north and south areas. In 15/9-2 the sands are dominantly of Facies Group II type and in 15/9-1 they are mainly of Facies Group I. Fig. B7 illustrates the diachronous facies patterns envisioned by Norsk Hydro.', 'Passage_id': 249}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In Dagny, these deposits are absent apart from thin veneer of condensed deposits overlyingthe reservoir sand. Assuming that these deposits were originally deposited over this area, then erosion at later date must have occurred over Dagny. Cycle I: Cycle is genetically related to Cycle II, representing further phase of oscillatory transgression and prograding deposition as illustrated in the Figs. B7 and B9. Simularly, this is also confined to the 15/9-1 and 15/9-2 wells, and has very similar facies types.', 'Passage_id': 250}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Sand deposition in the entire area was brought to close by the submergence of Cycle sands in further transgressive 'push southwards. Heather shale was then deposited over the entire area.- 16 - The absence of Heather Shale over the crestal regions, the Dagny feature in particular, is taken as evidence of active crestal erosion prior to deposition of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, or at least during the early part of Kimmeridge Clay deposition. Accordingly, truncation of the reservoir, could be expected on present day highs or paleohighs where they can be detected seismically. .

Overlapping of both west-east and north-east shoreline trends are therefore possibility. Fig. B6 illustrates the facies zones, showing diachronous southwards migration of sandy coastal margin facies. Both Models and II clearly demonstrate that the morphology of the Dagny reservoir, is directly related to that of the reservoir in the Sleipner area, particularly that of the 15/6 area.', 'Passage_id': 252}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Model III: This model is more of compromise between the two preceding models. It attempts to reconcide the differences in interpretation of environments of deposition, and the differences in timing of sand deposition. These are best explained by the diagram in Fig B8. Any attempts to account for sand distribution in this area are therefore inadequate without structural/tectonic dimension.', 'Passage_id': 253}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In general, the structural model outlined in the first report has not been changed. Salt modified grabenal tectonics during the late middle and Upper Jurassic explain the orientation of the Sleipner Terrace and associated flank basins, and fit into an order of events illustrated by thickening/thinning of Callovian/Oxfordian sediments. The sedimentological thinking of Norsk Hydro was confirmed by the Robertson Research report, which contains an excellent summary of the order of events. These results are consistent with the conclusions of the latest Norsk Hydro seismic interpretation of the Jurassic: That no evidence of movements can be found before the end of the deposition of the coal measures. ii conform band of reflectors some 220 thick, overlying the coal sequence in the southern part of the area is observed in flank areas, and interpreted as indicating no significant movement until after deposition of the reservoir (Callovian) sands.', 'Passage_id': 254}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: iii This conform band of reflectors appears to be truncated in 15/9-2 (50 in of erosion), whereas it is complete in 15/6-5.

B1.9 Reservoirs B1.9.1 Dagny-Sleipner Reservoir: The basic conditions of the reservoir are unchanged from the earlier report: Reservoir comprises Upper Jurassic sands. Seal comprises Upper Jurassic Heather. Formation shales.

The Dagny reservoir is by this model, entirely comprised of Cycle III sands, which are prognosed as sheet marine sandstone of considerable depositional extent. The indications are however, that these are limited to the north of 15/5-1 by shale out as deeper marine conditions are experienced. No further stratigraphic limit is anticipated in the Dagny feature, but the anticipated crestal erosion discussed im the previous section may reduce the reservoir thickness of the higher parts to the southeast, and probably diminish the present calculated reserves. - 19 - B1.9.2 15/5-1 Reservoir relation to 15/5-2: According to each of the models reported above, the reservoir formation encountered in Dagny is expected to shale-out between 15/5-1 and 15/5-2, therefore precluding the 'possibility of any significant continuation northwards.\", 'Passage_id': 258}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: An earlier correlation which suggested that the marine sands found in 15/5-2 (4032.5-4085 m) could be connected to the 15/5-1 sands, is now abandoned due to very good evidence of significant age differences. However, in view of the diachronous southwards migration of marine front interpreted in these models this then indicates the possibility of new reservoir formation in the north in 15/5, consisting of coastal deposits similar to those of the Dagny area, but of an earlier age/stage in the transgression. In similar manner, the control of sand distribution and trapping mechanism would also be combination of stratigraphy and structure.

For the fixed platform scheme the wellhead flowing pressure is approximately 325 bar. To maintain years plateau ' production of gas, it is evident from the production- and wellhead pressure curves (Fig-D-7 and D-8) that processing pressure of 70 bar is favourable. satisfactory natural separation of gas and associated liquids also takes place at 70 bar.\", 'Passage_id': 285}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Moreover, the adiabatic expansion across the choke will lower the fluid temperature and hence reduce the cooler load. For the purpose of project economy minimum processing philosophy has been adopted on 15/5. See figures E-1, E-2, E-3 and Table E-1.

Later in the platteau production period re- duced expansion will increase the cooler load somewhat. Separation Separation will be undertaken in single three-phase sepa- ration at 70 bal. The liquid residence time initially will be about minutes which is adequate for vapour/liquid sepa- ration and reasonable for water/oil separation in the first years when water production is small. In later years, the reduced flowing liquid volume will lead to improved separa- tion efficiency if the proportion of water is increasing.', 'Passage_id': 288}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The primary separator has been sized for full field flow and a separate test separator has been provided. Water separation will take place in the main separator and discharge will be controlled by an interface controller. A single vessel separator is proposed. Glycol Dehyration Although molecular sieve or low temperature separation could be proposed, there is no requirement in this processing scheme for hydrocarbon dewpoint control.', 'Passage_id': 289}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Tr-ethylene gly- col dehydration has been proposed due to its flexibility, ease of operation and accepted status for use on water dew- point control to quite stringent levels.

Condensate Treatment Despite the ability of glycol contactor to remove the majority of water from the gas phase, calculations show that recombination of gas and untreated condensate will reintroduce certain amount of free water in the sea- line.

Various inhibitors must be injected continuously, but even then the combination of free water and the high CO2-content makes the alternative unfavourable.\\\\ In future, more detailed study the technical- and economical feasibility of installing condensate dehyd- ration unit on 15/5 should be examined in detail.', 'Passage_id': 291}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: At this stage it seems that separate condensate line from 15/5 to Sleipner would be favourable alternative to condensate reinjection.

One option is to pre-drill the.seven wells from semisubmersible through guidance template.', 'Passage_id': 298}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The semi-submersible is then removed and the production platform installed with workover rig on it, which then completes the wells. The second option is the conventional one of erecting the production platform first of all, then drill and complete all seven wells with the same large rig mounted on it. This would probably be retained for subsequent use on workovers. This second alternate is less expensive drilling operation, but takes approximately year longer to bring the wells into production, as will be seen from the following detailed des- cription of the two alternates. a. Pre-drilling from semi-submersible The semi-submersible would be totally self-supporting for the drilling work and would provide accommodation aboard for the ship's crew, the drilling crew, and service personnel.\", 'Passage_id': 299}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It would include helideck and crane for personnel and mate- rials transfer. The semi-submersible will need tugs for towage in and out, but the other support services required whilst drilling, i.e. helicopters work boats, standby boat, etc., are common to both options. The semi-submersible could commence work at an early date determined by the delivery date for the template and the time required to negotiate suitable contracts and obtain delivery of the semi-submersible itself, and all well consumables. When semi-submersible is used, then the wells have to be left cased and provided with facilities for subsequent tie back of the casing to the wellhead deck of the platform before they can be completed by the workover rig on the platform. This is well established technique employed in shallower water, but not yet proven for North Sea depths.', 'Passage_id': 300}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The semi-submersible cannot be brought back to complete the wells after installation of the platform nor for subsequent workovers since platform in North Sea conditions would have to have its deck 100 feet above sea level to be clear of the 'maximum waves. Therefore, platform mounted workover rig is required for these operations. One decision to be made is whether workover rig should be purchased and installed permanently on the platform or whether it would be better to hire complete self-contained workover rig for temporary installation on the platform, firstly for initial completion of the wells, then subsequently for say two, maybe three workover on each of the wells during the life of the field, and finally for plugging off the wells. In the Gulf of nexico, it is the normal procedure, although, not yet in the North Sea, for modularized workover rigs to be made available to operators by contractors for hire. These units can be very compact, and provided that platform includes two 40 ton cranes (at 12 reach) the workover rig packages can beC. transported by work boat and liftet aboard with the platform cranes.\", 'Passage_id': 301}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: If contractor cannot be encouraged to provide rig when required, then an alternative would be to buy such rig. b. Tie-back 02erations This has been common parctice in shallower water using jack-up rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and the southern part of the North Sea; also using semi-submersibles in the Gulf of Mexico and offhore Indonesia. Union Oil in Indonesia used shallow water tie-back sytem designed by Vetco. They and the National Supply Company have also used their tie-back equipment in the Gulf of Mexico.', 'Passage_id': 302}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: However, no tie-backs have yet been made in deep water in the North Sea, but are being planned by number of operators for 1980/81. Cameron are undertaking to provide prototype tie-back system for 19 wells in the Maureen field in 100 of water, which can accommodate 2 of misalignment. They have another design on paper for up to 5 misalignment. The National Supply Company also has prototype design on paper which is development of their shallow water experience and allows for the well to be 11/2 out of vertical and the plat- form to be 2 off vertical in addition. Vetco have developed deep water tie-back system from the shallow water system they have used in Indonesia and.', 'Passage_id': 303}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: the Gulf of Mexico and have made presentation concerning it to Norsk Hydro in Norway. Their system seems to be the most advanced design to date and will first be installed on Fulmar in March/April. 1980. They also have made proposals for NW Hutton, S. Montrose, Tiffany, and Maureen fields. The basic problem with tie-back of wells in deep water is toensure that there is minimum of misalignment.', 'Passage_id': 304}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: First of all, the top 100-150m of the well should be within 10 of vertical, secondly, the platform must be sufficiently closely positioned over the template and vertical, so that the casing from the wellhead on the platform to the seabed tie-back has an overall misalignment with the well bore of less than about 2o, and this should not be aggravated by settlement of the platform, nor by excessive manufacturing tolerances on the jacket or template. Location of the jacket accurately over thea template should not be too difficult using an acoustic reference system and addi- tional control by underwater television and floodlights, so that guide funnels on the jacket are lowered over piles pro- jecting from the template. Piling jacket into the seabed, so that it is vertical, is also'anestablished technique. c. Drilling and Completion from Fixed Platform First the self-contained production and drilling platform is constructed and installed, together with all its top-side facilities including heavy drilling rig complete with associa- ted equipment and services. The wells would be totally comple-\", 'Passage_id': 305}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: ted by this drilling rig with final production wellheads at the wellhead deck of the platform. This option entails heavier rig and considerably more drill- pipe and casing and other consumables on the platform than the workover rig in the pre-drilling scheme. After completion of the wells, it is worth considering whether there is an economic case for removal of this rig and selling it, then bringing on rented workover rig for the brief periods when it is required in the future. This would eliminate the heavy maintenance cost of keeping the original rig out there for workovers during the working life of the platform. How- ever, the platform still has to be designed to be large enough to accommodate the larqe initial drilling rig.', 'Passage_id': 306}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It is evident that drilling cannot start until the larger plat- form and jacket have been designed, built, placed, and then all the modlues installed on the deck, using an expensive der- rick barge spred. After initial installation and commissioning of the drilling rig modules and provision of accommodation and services, it will be possible to commence drilling while hook- up continues on the production modlues. d. Miscellaneous The two optional drilling modes would require different levels of storage capacity for fuel, drilling equipment, well consuma- bles, and stores.', 'Passage_id': 307}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: By pre-drilling, the wells, alle the drilling equipment, well consumables, and stores to support the drilling operation will have been channelled through the semi-submersible operation leaving only the tie-back and drilling out capacity require- ment of the workover rig requiring support. The high level of CO2 will demand strictly controlled practices to deal with corrosion. These will include continuous injection of filming amine inhibitor as well as glycol to prevent the formation of hydrates. . . E Platform Configuration For the purposes of this study, it was decided to adopt con- ventional piled jacket as the basis of.comparison. The design of such structures is well proven, and reliable weight and cost estimates for the structure can be developed with comparative ease.', 'Passage_id': 308}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Time and costs of installation of such structures are prone to uncertainties such as weather and the market supply, an demand of offshore support units. Nevertheless, sufficient historical information from North Sea operations is available to realistically quantify the likely range of costs. A piled steel jacket of this sort is probably not the most cost effective fixed structure for this location. Section 1.1.5 deals with the alternatives that exist and from this superficial examination, it is probable that the single leg jack-up concept, with pre-commissioned topside equipment installed over predrilled template would be comparable in cost. a. Influence of Method of Installation Barge launching the structure on location is the conventional method of installation, followed by controlled flooding to up-', 'Passage_id': 309}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: right the structure and final sinking to the seabed. If such a method is adopted, at least one face of the structure must have two parallel lauch tracks, and strong launch truss must be incorporated internally. This implies that at least legs must be used arranged in two rows of 4. The major disadvantage of such an eight-leg structure is that the wave force attracted are larger than for more open four legged structure . This is only true, however, if provision for installation is not considered and for heavier structures.', 'Passage_id': 310}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The conventional North Sea approach has been to build large self-floating legs, which attract considerable extra wave force, (e.g. Thistle, Ninian, Magnus) or fabricate purpose built floa- taion rafts, which can be submerged with the structure atta- ched (e.g. Froties). The Forties system is not now favoured because of the lack of resuability of the floatation rafts and in each case, considerable extra problems of fabrication are introduced. The most complex and time consuming fabrication for self-floating jackets is for the floatation legs on the ground,,and this must be substantially complete before the main jacket structure can be built. This.complicatps', 'Passage_id': 311}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: and extends the fabrication process. A four legged structure without provision for installation will generally weight less because of the reduced wave forces and more open structure. It is not as redundant as an eight leggedft jacket and fabrication details at nodes are more complex although there are fewer nodes. Generally therefore, where possbile, barge launched jackets appearto be the most approporate. Recently the Murchison field development has extended the proven range .of barge launching, although at this stage the Magnus jacket in 180 of water was considered too large and was designed as self-floating tower.', 'Passage_id': 312}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: For the structures considered in this study, with light pay- loads, it would seem logical to use barge launched structure. However, it may be possible, with the heavy lifting capacities now available, to consider lifting the structure into position from barge. This is common method of installation else- where in the world, but has not been attempted in the Northern North Sea. The final alternative, which has not been attemped on any major jacket, is to consider side launching of jacket. This final option, whilst potentially attractive, is not considered in this study because it relies on equipment that does not at present exist.', 'Passage_id': 313}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: b. Structural Weights The weight of the jacket for the full drilling rig and barge launched case Was evaluated from member by member sizing exercise, leading to jacket weight which would be expected to be within 10% of the final design weight.

One may conclude that today there are no clear guidelines as to which type of structures are the most suitable. Very few of the currently proposed schemes have been put into practice, and due to this lack of proven technology, no structural op- tion has been clearly identified as the most satisfactory. It has been intended in this part of the study to examine range of structures available to support equipment and con- ductors.', 'Passage_id': 315}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Where certain structures have clear limitations in application (e.g. an upper bound to payload) these have been identitied. Otherwise, approximate weight guidelines are given where appropriate. a. Articulated Towers Articulated towers have found use as flare towers, and loa- ding facilities in the North Sea. Generally low payload has been required. Designs are feasible for payloads up to 000 tonnes, so that wave loading 3oes n-Dt induce excessive cyclic loading range on the lower articulation. Figure E-7 shows design found feasible for 000 tonnes payload and probable rela- tionship between total steel weight and topside payload is shown in Figure E-8.', 'Passage_id': 316}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In shallower water with large payload requirements it is difficult to reconcile the conflicting requirements of main- taining the vertical cyclic loading within practical r.ange and ensuring the structure is stable in the event of joint failure. It is probable that for 120 water depth 000 tonnes is the maximum practical paylod. As well as this limi- tation, the reliability of the articulation and flexible risers around the articulation would require closer scrutiny. Elastomeric universal joint designs do allow for high pressure flow through them. This is limited to two lines, and it is unlikely that the maximum diameter possible is adequate for gas flow.', 'Passage_id': 317}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Generally, therefore, gas must be carried around the universal joint in flexible (Coflexip) pipes of comparatively large diameter. A field development using such structure would probably re- quire subsea manifold centre with drilling performed from semi-submersible. The number of risers would then be reduced to minimum and thus the complexity of the lower articulation reduced. typical development pattern is shown in Figure E-9 The probable limitation in payload of 000 tonnes, together with the mainentance requirements of the articulation and by-', 'Passage_id': 318}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: pass hoses suggest that this type of structure is not suitable. It should also be noted that it is unlikely that drilling or workover operations could be performed from the structure. b. Multi-leg Jackup Conventional multi-leg jackups are limited in the water depth for which they can be satisfactorily designed. The absence of bracing between the legs requires the legs and deck to act as a portal frame, where maximum moments occur at the moveable intersection between legs and deck.', 'Passage_id': 319}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The complexity of design at these areas, together with the fundamental sway frequency effectively limits the economic maximum water depth. The largest jackups in operation in the North Sea are the DYVI, type DYVI Beta and DYVI Gamma. Each has claimed maximum operating depth of 107 (350 ft),and payload capacity of 4 000 tonnes, either as drilling or production equipment. fundamental natural frequency of sec can be expected at 95 m (310 ft) water depth with much reduced fatigue life. An independent study has shown that for water depth of just less than 100 (325 ft) and design wave of 25 (80 ft), converted DYVI jackup without foundation mat was deficient in fatigue life, and maximum stresses in deck and legs due to excessive dynamic magnification of the design wave.', 'Passage_id': 320}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It may be possible to extend the depth capability of such jackup to 120 (390 ft) as requred for the field, by introdu- cing foundation mat. Alternatively, piled foundations providing fixity, and reducing the effective length of the legs can be used. The conductors required for tie back from template to the jackup need support and protect.ton, and this must be provided by small well protection jacket. Such jacket can be totally independent from the jackup or linked at the top. In the former case, allowance in the conductor design for consi- derable differential movement must be made.', 'Passage_id': 321}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The weight of suitable well head protection jacket will be in the order of 250 tonnes with approximately 850 tonnes of piling in addition. The cost of purchase of second-hand DYVI type jackup is not quoted here, and must be subject of detailed negotiation. Conversion of the jackup involves the replacement of bottom sections of legs, removing drilling equipment, installing pro- duction equipment and fabrication of foundation mat with leg stubs and leg connection fabilities. The mat and stub legs can be expected to use 500 tonnes of structural steel. c. Non-Buoyant Jack-us', 'Passage_id': 322}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: An alternative to the conventional jack-up is the non-buoyant multi-leg jackup . The structure is transported by means ofbarge, which is not significant penalty for the one off transportation process. It is argued that the open truss deck is far more versatile, and production packages can be lifted in as and when required. For loading intensities and span to depth rations encountered in offshore structures, study has shown that there is no significant difference in steel weight. However, in can be expected that the plate girder type hull construction is more easily automated, and will fit in with established shipyard fabrication techniques.', 'Passage_id': 323}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The fabrication .cost should therefore be less. It is not considered worthwhile pursuing the truss deck con- cept any further at present because it is subject to the same depth limitations as conventional jackup and is unlikely to be cheaper. However, the open structure of the deck may offer an advantage in versatility, and this will be considered if, during the course of the study, such need arises. The design of non-buoyant jack-up is covered in part at least by variety of patents in the name of James G. Brown & Assoc. Inc. (Houston). d.', 'Passage_id': 324}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Single leg Jackup The concept of using central single leg, has been shown to extend the rafige of jackups beyond the accepted limitations of a multi-leg jackup. The basic structural action is changed from that of portal frame with highly unceratin degree of fixity at the base to vertical cantilever. Maximum stresses always occur at the intersection between the leg and the foun- dation, and not at the movable point of deck support. Installation of the structure relies on both the hull and the mat being watertight and buoyant, and is in four phases, fol- lowed by pre-loading the foundations.', 'Passage_id': 325}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The structure is towed using the mat for buoyancy. In this condition, the structure is adequately (if not excessively)1. stable for ocean towing. The remaining phases shown in Figure E-10 are self-explanatory, and model tests have been performed to verify the safety of all phases of the operation. Pre- loading of the foundation is requirement for all jackup operations in the Northe Sea.', 'Passage_id': 326}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The structure is slender compared with conventional jacket, and hence it can be expected to be more dynamically sensitive. Of necessity, the leg must remain of uniform cross section, and hende the structure must remain slender. For the soil conditions, fundamental natural sway periods of 4.25 to seconds can be expected. For comparison,a simple steel gravity alternative to the single leg jack up is also examined. Ignoringfor the moment, the prob- lems of installing such structure without the use of large amounts of additional buoyancy, the natural frequency of this structure for 11 000 tonnes payload is likely to be seconds.', 'Passage_id': 327}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The foundation performance is the single most important aspect of the flexibility of the structure, and the comparatively slender leg is not of such major importance. The flexibility of the mat contributes signifantly, to the overall flexibility of the single leg jackup, whereas for the jacket type confi- guration it is not important. The design of these structures against fatigue failure requires special consideration. Studies have shown that welded nodes with adequate fatigue life characteristics can be designed, and it would be expected, although not directly referred to in any offshore regulations, that the use of cast steel nodes would improve actual fatigue life further. Cast steel nodes may of-', 'Passage_id': 328}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: fer cost benefit in the case of single leg jackup, because of the repetitive nature of the nodes. Single leg jackups can be installed over an existing drilling template. The foundation concept consisting of three or four separate circular feet allows safe installation to take place.(1) A wide variety of ground conditions can be catered for using this foundation configuration. Is is possible to adjust vir- tually independently the ratio of stress on each foot due to overturning forces and vertical forces, by adjusting the spa- cing of the feet, and the area of each foot respectively.', 'Passage_id': 329}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Designs for suitable jacks and the single leg jackup concept are covered in part at least by patents held by The Offshore Company (Houston). e. Steel Gravity Structure The steel gravity structure shown in Figure E-11 as an alterna- tive to the single leg jackup weights less than the single leg jackup. Unfortunately, the means of installation of such structure add considerably to the weight or complexity of operations. Two basiv alternatives exist: a) Installing the foundation mat independently, and connecting the jacket on location b)', 'Passage_id': 330}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Providing large auciliary buoyancy tanks to provide stabi- lity during controlled flooding and sinking vertically. Option a)is extremely weather depdenent, both the sinking of the mat and the installation of tower. Both operations require the use of one or two derrick barges. Option b) has benefit if oil storage is required but for gas field development there is no significant use that can be made of the buoyancy tanks. The tanks would normally be desig- ned to support the full hydrostatic head and hence are heavy.', 'Passage_id': 331}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It is estimated that provision of buoyancy tanks for control- led sinking operation without the deck installed would require buoyancy tanks weighing approximately 000 t. The complexity of the controlled flooding operation must not be underestimated and the operation cannot be performed with the deck installed. The use of such steel gravity structure for this location has advantages in that piling is not necessary. However, installation of the deck and topside followed by hook-up and commissioning offshire is necessary. f. Tethered Buoyant Platforms Two main types of tethered buoyant platform can be identified. a) Vertically restrained platforms, capable of sway motions, but not heave.', 'Passage_id': 332}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: b) Fully restrained platforms, where the calbes are inclined. The fully restrained platform attracts wave forces larger than a conventional jacket because of the large buoyant sections that must be incorporated in the structure near the water sur- face. The problem of providing enough cables and particula-rly providing anchorages to withstand these forces has not been solved economically and the option of using inclined cables is not feasible at present. (0 Vertically restrained platforms are compliant in the sway and surge freedoms, and hefice do not attract such large wave for- ces. The risers must be capable of withstanding the transla- tions of the deck but because of the vertical restraint no heave compensation is required. .', 'Passage_id': 333}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: This is one stage better than the catenary anchored semi-submersible where, because of the limitations in the travel of the required heave compensation device, continuous production is not possible. A tethered buoyant platform is obviously not suitable for the application and is not disvussed further.g. Concrete Gravity Strcutures It has been claimed that concrete gravity structures have the advantages of: (1) Simple installation consiting of controlled, flooding and skirt penetration: (2) Minimal offshore operations, because most of the topside can be transported with the structure: (3) Ease of removal Concrete structures have only partly lived up to these expectations and steel structures appear now to be the p;.eferred solution. The storage offered by concrete structure is of no benefit for gas field development of this sort and generally concrete structures have been used for very large topside load requirements. concrete structure is un- likely to be suitable for this water depth and this topside payload.', 'Passage_id': 334}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It is not intended to investigate this structural type further.

REMOTE CONTROLLED SUBSEA SYSTEM E.1.2.1 System Description and Operating Considerations (/ The 15/5 DAGNY field- be produced from eight completed wells, through 10 slot template, each delivering nominal 1 million normal cubic metres of gas per day plus an initial nominal 428 stock tank cubic metres per day of condensate. The annual average production target corresponds to full pro- duction from six wells, thus allowing 25% spare capacity for ,downtime throughout the year. The product will be piped distance of 20 km to central platform in the Sleipner area.', 'Passage_id': 335}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The principal scheme studied is for vertical well interven- tion, through wet Xmas trees from surface vessel equipped for drilling and wireline operations. T.F.L. system is also studied but not recommended. 'The trees will be controlled by means of an electro-hydraulic multiplex system from individual control pods, retrievable normally during workover operations, but which may also be diver retrievable using :a suitable support vessel. Initial wellhead pressure is 372 bar, and the wellhead flowing pressure is about 325 bar. Estimated wellhead temperature is 88C.\", 'Passage_id': 336}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The sales pipeline is designed for maximum working pressure of 170 bar and hence choking would initially be re- quired at each wellhead. The temperature drop across the chokes is estimated to maximum 22C, which will provide minimum gas temperature of 66C entering the pipeline. The field production profile provides for steady rate of drainage over the first four years of operation, during which time the wellhead flowing pressure will decline from 325 bar to 70 bar. Thereafter, pressure of 70 bar is main- tained by cutting back the flow from individual wells. (See Figures D-7, D-8 and Table D-5)A 20 diameter, multiphase flow, thermally insulated sales pipeline connects the subsea installation to the assumed central platform 20 km away.', 'Passage_id': 337}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: During initial operation, up to about 22% liquids are pre- dicted in the sales pipeline, and preliminary pipeline and slug catcher designs have been prepared on that basis. The multiphase flow will reach the central Sleipner platform at minimum pressure of 50 bar and temperature of approxi- mately 59C. With the proposed system, it will be possible to adjust the pipeline and the platform operating pressures within limits during the initial years when liquid production is highest, i.e. when multiphase operational problems will be most severe. In the event of major hold up of liquid during unstable conditions (e.g. after shut down), it will be possible to clear the sales pipeline by spheres from subsea sphere- launcher system holding up' to six spheres. With gas velocities up to about 14 m/sec (45 ft/sec) at full production, there should be no need to pass spheres during normal operation.\", 'Passage_id': 338}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Well testing would be carried out at surface vessel, equip- ped for drilling and testing operations, located above the well cluster. A pipeline between platform and subsea cluster is proposed for well killing. However killing from surface drilling vessel might provide adequate safety cover since most killing operations are under- taken in controlled circumstances. Glycol injection is required to prevent the formation of hyd- rates downhole, after the choke and in the pipeline during start-up. It will only be necessary for glycol to be injec- ted while individual wells are being brought on stream ancl after the sales pipeline has been shut down.', 'Passage_id': 339}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Glycol would be supplied via pipeline pressurized to 480 bar at the cen- tral platform, and distributed via subsea manifold at the cluster. Mono-ethylene glycol is recommended for this purpbse because of its greater effectiveness per unit volume injected, and its lower viscosity which will reduce pumping costs. Corrosion inhibitor is required to be injected either conti- nuously or in regular doses to Prevent CO2 pitting corrosion in the tubing, manifold, and pipeline. Inhibitor may be sup- ik plied either via separate 1/2 pipeline to the cluster or blended in with glycol.', 'Passage_id': 340}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The overall system is shown diagrammatically in figure E-12. The use of templated cluster of wells to produce field will yield advantages in installation and control of the wells. However, once all the wells on the template are completed and producing, re-entry requirements will almost certainly neces- sitate safety shutdowr, of all adjacent wells, at least during the running and retrieval of blow out preventers and tie-back risers. The conceptual sketch in figure E-13 shows the proposed tem- plate layout.', 'Passage_id': 341}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It has 10 slots and near central manifold base. The Xmas trees are individually retrievable to allowfor major serviceingz, although much tree equipment is pro- posed to be diver serviceable without recourse to floating drilling vessel. Flowlines and service lines are pre-plumbed on the template between each slot and the manifold base. Vertical flow line connectors are provided to allow the trees to be stab connec- ted to the template plumbing.', 'Passage_id': 342}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The near centrally mounted sphere launching/manifold base allows minimum bunching of pre-plumbed flowlines and is at the most protected point on the template. The template should be of tubular structure. Its configu- ration, piling points and height have been designed to pro- vide security against trawl board and anchor damage. The template needs six independent piles to secure it to the seabed and to avoid that the well casings will contribute to resisting trawl board and anchor loads. Template levelling , will be by diver intervention and hydraulic jacking systems.', 'Passage_id': 343}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The height of the template is extended up to the top of the Xmas tree assemblies. The amount of steel construction may result in weight in air of up to 300 tonnes, including pre- plumbed pipe work, etc. The design of the template construction must allow easy and safe access by divers to each tree for servicing valves, actuators, chokes, and sensors.a. Downhole and wellhead Due to the remote location of the Xmas trees and the possi- bility of trawl board impact on them, consideration has to be given to the safety of the wells, if trees are torn off. It is recommended that each well should be equipped with two fail-safe downhole safety valves (DHSV) the lower DHSV to be tubing retrievable and the upper one to be wireline retrieva- ble.', 'Passage_id': 344}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It should be mentioned that no examples are known of such an arrangement in current practice. At the wellhead, between the 5/8 casing and the lower down- hole safety valve, five tubes have to be accomodated in the annulus. - 41/2 production tubing, in 12% chromium steel - short annulus access or kill string of minimum diameter 2 7/8 - Downhole mono-ethylene glycol injection line down to an in- jection valve/nozzle set just above the upper DHSV.

Xmas Tree Arrangement It is recommended to use simple 10 000 psi, wireline compa- tible, non-T.F.L., diver assisted wet Xmas tree.', 'Passage_id': 345}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The arrange- ment is shown in diagramic form in fig. E-14. At the top of the tree above the swab valves should be tie- back or re-rentry spool piece to allow vertical entry to thewell for workover purposes. Normally corrosion cap will be set on top of the tie-back spool. In addition to the corro- sion cap, surrounding it and at about the same level should be fitted debris protection cap.', 'Passage_id': 346}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: This extends between the guide posts and protect the rest of the tree, valve actuators, flowlines, control pod, etc. from falling debris. It is recommended that vertical flowline connectors are employed to ease the installation of the tree onto the template and mani- fold during completion and tie-in, and any subsequent major workover which may involve pulling the tree. Use of vertical flowline, glycol, inhibitor and kill line connections will allow more pre-plumbing of the temnlate and manifold, thereby reducing the subsea plumbing content. All the valves, with the exception of the annulus and produc- tion swab valves, will be under production control from the central platform. . During workover and completion operations, workover control will be established which will inhibit pro- duction control, and also operate the swab valves and other hydraulic functions not associated with production operations.', 'Passage_id': 347}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The inclusion of Hi-Lo pilot is recommended to provide automatic shutdown control, although the use of these pilots subsea is not understood to be proven practice. The production chokes will be of the multiple orifice type. The entire choke should be diver replaceable. The choke is hydraulically operated by using reversible pressure com- pensated stepping actuator. Flow rates can be approximated by reference to differential pressure and choke aperture.', 'Passage_id': 348}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Production fluids are passed from the choke, through control valve, to the production manifold. A life of nine months to three years can be expected from the production choke trim. It is recommended that regular annual replacement of all discs is carried out. Injection metering is required both down hole and into the production fluids. The glycol/inhibitor supply is providedfrom an injection supply manifold through an individual inlet control valve.', 'Passage_id': 349}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The amount of fluid to be injected may vary considerably as the proportions of glycol and corrosion inhi- bitor are varied. It is, therefore, proposed that remote controllable regulating device is used for production injec- tion. Examples of subsea variable displacement metering pumps have not been found and would, no doubt, provide maintenance complications. It is proposed that the regulating function is carried out by remote control valves and variable choke at each wellhead, provided with injection fluid under suitable pressure from common manifold.

In general, the use of sensors subsea is not widespread. All sensors should be diver replaceable, and it is recommended that, for every sensor position shown on the diagram, at least two are actually fitted, to provide redundancy. E.1.2.4 The Manifolds and Sphere Launching Systems a. Manifolds - Each tree will be connected to the sales manifold, the kill manifold, the inhibitor manifold, and the glycol manifold by vertical stab type connectors.', 'Passage_id': 351}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The manifold system is pre-plumbed into the template for ease of installation.

To protect the sales pipe- line against overpressure, it is proposed to connect an emer- gency relief system to the sales manifold leading away from the template.\", 'Passage_id': 352}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The relief valve would be actuated by excessline pressure and would re-set automatically. In the event of an emergency well shut-in being delayed, the relief system would allow short controlled gas blow-out situation to exist at safe distance from the cluster without damaging the installation. b.

The sphere launching system as shown in fig. E-16, which forms separate tree, will be connected to the sales line by 20 collet type vertical connector and to the glycol manifold, by stab connector.

For sphere release during operation, control would be from the central platform. For sphere loading, the production control pod may be used but, preferably, it may be replaced with hydraulic workover pod controlled directly from the support vessel. Retrieval of the sphere launching tree, as proposed, would be major operation involving shut-down and purging of the sales . pipeline and disconnection of 20 subsea flange.', 'Passage_id': 355}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: With further development of the outline design, some improvement could no doubt be effected but it should be appreciated that the system forms part of pipeline. It has to be stressed that this subsea sphere launcher system only represents basis from which possible design could be developed. To our knowledge no such system has been put into service.

Where an annulus leak is discovered, depending on its nature, it can be bled into the production flow-line via the crossover valve, or it can be shut off at the well head, allowing unknown pressure to build up in the annulus, or the annulus can be flooded with kill fluid to seal it and control the leak. All these actions are temporary pending full workover availability. The advantage of kill line is to be able to control the annulus with kill fluid immediately from the platform. The cost of high pressure kill line, mainifold valves, mud pumps, mixing equipment and the kill fluid solution itself, has to set against this advantage.', 'Passage_id': 367}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: For this project, kill line and mainfold is assumed. However, it is felt that further investigation on the cost effectiveness of this solution should be undertaken before a final decision is made to include the facility. E.1.2.8 Discussion of Scheme For this alternative the main difficulties concern: - Multiphase fluid characteristics, associated water and CO2 The initial pressure of the reservoir - The distance between the template and the Sleipner central platform. The number one problem is the potensial hydrate formation and corrosion in the production lines. Proper inhibitor injection is difficult to achive.', 'Passage_id': 368}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: As hydrate inhibitor methanol should be considered because its better diffusion ability than glycol. Assuming that the transportation probleM can be solved we feel that subsea production system is feasible. However, the proposed system raises several questions which have to be answered befor final recomendation can be made. The subsea system, as it is proposed in appendix 3, is to some extend overcomplicated and potensial further study on this alternative should, among other things, try to simplify the system. We feel that the following parts needs special attention and further investigation: - Design of subsea sphere launching system - Technical/economical investigation of an insolated pipe- line and possible high pressure pipeline instead of subsea choking and subsea pressure relief system.', 'Passage_id': 369}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: - Operational and safety aspects with remote wellkillingE.2 The central processing platform in the Sleipner area is assumed in this study to be placed on the 13-structure in block 15/9. The distance to the satellite field 15/5 is approximately 20 km. With fixed platform on the 15/5 block dual pipeline transportation system seems to be the best alternative.

The gas arrives through gas riser, sphere receiver and into an inlet separation unit where the pipeline condensate is knocked out. The condensate is dumped into the condensate line upstream of the coalescer.', 'Passage_id': 371}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: As the gas is dehydrated at the 15/5 platform no further de- hydration should be necessary at the Sleipner platform. Before entering the assumed common gas treatment/compression system, the gas should go through custo transfer metering station as the gas and the condensate might be sold to different customers. If this will be the case, the gas metering unit on the 15/5-platform may be ommited. Power generation requirements and control room facilities are provided from the main platform systems.

The consultant Hollobone, Hibbert and Ass. proposes that the multiphase flow from the sales pipeline passes through a subsea slug catcher at the platform base and that individual risers deliver gas and liquids for further separation on the platform.

The evaluation of materials, corrosion and corrosion prevention is based on the reservoir data given in section D. As normal experience, but, not always, H2S is present in hydrocarbons containing CO2. Further, the H2S concentration tends to increase with productiontime. Based on this, and the unaccurate H2S-analysis for 15/5, and the fact that the close 15/6 Sleipner gas has 16 ppm H2S, the effect of H2S should be evaluated although only traces are detected.', 'Passage_id': 377}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The chloride concentration of 15/5 is not analysed, but based on normal North Sea reservoir chloride content of 1-10% and the 15/5 tubing temperature range 75-125C, the environ- ment in the 15/5 wells would be highly corrosive. If, in addition, solid particles are produced, the situation will be even worse as erosion of protective layers and metal will take place, accelerating erosioncorrosion attacks. These problems are discussed in appendix 5, and summary is given in the following. Tubing corrosion can be prevented by use of: 1.

The materials are, however, not resistant to CO2 corrosion, which makes downhole inhibitor injection necessary. This is also true for low alloy materials like AIS1 4130 and SAE 4135.', 'Passage_id': 380}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Within this group of materials, L-80 is recommended for the 15/5 Dagny field due to strength requirements. Inquiries have been made to various suppliers of corrosion inhibitors for their recommendations as to inhibitor treat- ment, based on the 15/5 field data. The proposed inhibitors were of neutralizing and filming amine type, soluble in water and glycol. The final selection of inhibitors for down- hole continuously injection program must be based on the actual and detailed environmental data for Block 15/5. It is recommended that the most promising inhibitor blends are comprehensively tested under conditions simulating the severe environment of 15/5, e.g. gunk tests in high pressure, high temperature autoclaves for at least one month time each run to test stability and lifetime.', 'Passage_id': 381}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The tests should include checking of film persistency to high gas velocities (15 m/s), corrosion rates of tubing materials in inhibited, actual environment, as well as agressivity of inhibitor blends to gasket materials in the downhole'quipment.

Stainless Steels The resistant tubing materials recommended by tubing manufactures for the present application are martensitic and ferritic-austenitic stainless steels. The chemical composition and mechanical properties of these materialsare listed in Table E-2.

With possible question mark on the 13% Cr materials, they are also re- sistant to H2S: Normally chromium stainless steels are not considered resistant in this respect. However, the qualities listed are claimed by the manufacturers to have the same resistance as L-80 tubing due to special quenching and tempering treatment. This seems to be in agreement with NACE Standard MR-01-75 (1978 Revision). All the materials listed are considered fairly resistant to ahloride stress cracking, but the resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion at temperatures of 85-125.c and different chloride concentration needs further evaluation.', 'Passage_id': 384}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The tubing manufactures contacted have not been able (or willing) to document critical chloride concentration below which their stainless steels could be safely used without suffering from pitting or crevice corrosion at these temperatures. Nor have DnV or the oil companies. This form of corrosion would also be affected by the presence of oxygen, but little data are found on this matter. This information is essential, and when detailed analysis on 15/5 is available, testing of the most promising material qualities should be performed under conditions simulating the actual environment. Compared to the L-80 tubing in alternative No. 1, the austenitic stainless steels have low yield strength and can not be recommended for the present application.', 'Passage_id': 385}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The most interesting alternatives become the martensitic and the cold worked ferritic-austenitic materials. The coldworked materials are however quite new on the market. The only field experience is 11/2 year exposure of 20% cold worked material in German field. Based on offers per February 1979, the material costs of martensitic 13% Cr and ferittic-austenitic tubing are respectively 4-5 and 7-8 times that of L-80 tubing. Other corrosion resistant materials Application of exotic materials like special Ni-Cr-No-Mn alloy in Germany and Cr-Mo-Co alloys in the USA are reported in the litterature.', 'Passage_id': 386}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Such materials are not included in the present discussion as they are intended for the most severe environments (e.g. 27-46% H2S, 3-10% CO2) and the costs would be prohibitive. The effectiveness of corrosion prevention by inhibitor injection or use of resistant tubing materials should be monitored. This can be done by direct or indirect methods of detection. The disadvantage of the direct methods (e.g. observation and. measurements of damaged equipment, inspection by tools like the tubing caliper, records of leaks, repair and re- placements) is that the results are available only after some damage has taken place.', 'Passage_id': 387}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: By application of indirect methods the corrosion rate can be estimate before any significant damage has occured. The indirect methods most frequently used, are based on weight loss of corrosion coupons installed in the process steam, corrosometers measuring increase in electrical resistance as the thickness of probes are reduced by corrosion, and the corrater which is similar to the corrosmeter, but measuresthe galvanic current between small corroding steel electrodes (linear polarization probes). It is not found appropriate to go into detailed evaluation of the different methods at this stage in the project, but it should be mentioned that corrosion monitoring probes and instrumentation now are used more and more extensively in the North Sea. Often the operators having suffered sudden breakdown of equipment/tubings due to corrosion. Operators also claim that effective monitoring system of downhole inhibitor programs are essential, not only to monitor the inhibitor performance but also to optimize the dose rates and thereby costs.', 'Passage_id': 388}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It is hardly thinkable that the very corrosive gas of 15/5 could be produced without extensively corrosion monitoring instrumented wells and flowlines. Based on the information available today, Alternative No. 1: L-80 carbon steel tubing combined with inhibitor injection downhole, is recommended. This is based on reported experience, which for Alt. No. still is scarce.

The test program must therefore also include martensitic 13% Cr steels and ferritic-austenitic stainless steels.

Therefore carbon steel line must be protected by continuous injection of inhibitors at the wellhead, or stainless steel line has to be chosen dependant on how agressive the transporte gas is and the flow rate.

It is emphasized that the subsea production system used in this study is irrelevant to the system referred to elsewhere in this report.

The qualitative procedures also provide framework for the subsequent quantitative analysis in which efforts con- sentrate to assess the reliability characteristics numerical.

An important set of information is the minimum cut set, derived by qualitative analysis of fault tree.

There were not any major problems in using the computer progra: Generally the analytical techniques for availability calcula- tions assume immidiate repair action when components fail.

( E.3.2.9 Further work A problem mentioned above was that the starting time for repair of certain components was stochastic variable and that this might violate some of the basic theory.', 'Passage_id': 409}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: An investigation should be set off to check this. In this study only four programs, available to SINTEF, were used. We know that other programs for reliability analysis exist. The quality of these programs should be investigated. An Important question in design of subsea production system is the reliability requirements necessary both for system, sub- systems and basic components.', 'Passage_id': 410}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It should be possible to specify those requirements based on reliability analysis.

Cost and development for two jacket solutions, Scheme A and B, and one subsea production solution Scheme IIihave been considered by consultant and by partner according to technical assistant apointment. Based on this Hydro's estimate for capital cost, operating cost and field develop- ment for the three alternatives are as follow: Scheme I, Option Early production by drilling wells from semisubmersible and subsequent tie-back to fixed satellite platform.

Though the subsea production alternativ, Scheme II, represent a significant lower total capital cost, this option seems less attractiv due to the use of new and advanced technology on a number of areas, and also problems concerning corrosion and hydration in the pipeline, and inspection and maintenance of the subsea equipment which might result in poor regularity of the field. Because possible problems may occur during alignment of the tie-back operation, Scheme Option A, the conclusion of today is to go for the conventional jacket alternative 'Scheme Option B. But, by the time, probably in the beginning of the 1990's when the 15/5 field will be developed, the alignment problems during tie-back operation to the jacket have probably been solved in proper manner. If so, this alternative seems to be the best because it can start production about one year earlier than the conventional jacket alternative and results in about the same total capital cost.\", 'Passage_id': 414}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: F.1 COT COMPARISON F.1.1 INTRODUCTION The cost estimates are believed to be represetative of actual late 1979 costs. The costs have been evaluated for three alternatives:  Scheme IA - Conventional jacket with tie-back from pre drilled template.

GEOLOGY A. REGIONAL SETTING The 15/5 block is situated on the eastern flank of the Viking Trough. The Utsira High to the east has been positive feature since the Viking Trough was outlined in the Permian time, and was not completely submerged until Upper Cretaceous time. Throughout this time and particularily in the Lower and Middle Jurassic, the Utsira High has been substantial source of clastic sediments being washed into the basin to the west. The Fladen Ground Spur to the west, was not major source area until Oxfordian/Callovian time after having been uplifted in the late Bathonian.', 'Passage_id': 429}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Sediments from the west have not had any major influence in the eastern part of the 15/5 block, since the depocenter throughout Jurassic time lay to the west. Permian salt may have moved from early Upper Cretaceous time onward when the overburden became sufficient to initiate salt movement. Diapirism is not major structural element in this area, but may have modified the structural shape of the 15/5-1 structure at very late time. Structural evolution Since Triassic the 15/5 area has been affected by basin floor movements of great structural complexity. These structural movements generally can be described as continous basin subsidence with shorter breaks of uplift, faulting, tilting and even folding.', 'Passage_id': 430}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Superimposed and perhaps in association therewith there has been number of eustatic sealevel changes. At Bunter time the Viking trough was established. The 4644 , Lewe-r Jurassic was time of sediment infill in the central part of the subsiding Trougli, and sediments did onlap theflanks of the basin and did probably not reach the high 15/5-1 structure.

(Figure 111.1). During Callovian the 15/5-1 area was stable. To the west the basin subsided more rapidly. At end Callovian time tectonic pulse might have occurred with possible further splitting and movements of the fault blocks.', 'Passage_id': 432}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In Oxfordian the basin continued to subside and the 15/5-1 area was elevated The Utsira High to the east remained positive feature, but became less important as sediment source. The Fladen Ground Spur to the west was tectonically active and became the main source of sediments filling in the Viking Trough. (Figure 111.2). The Kimmeridgian was marked by another pulse of faulting and thrusting although of minor importance to the 15/5-1 structure. (Figure 111.3).', 'Passage_id': 433}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: During Lowex Cretaceous the 15/5-1 was affected by the strongest relative vertical movement due to uplift of the Sleipner area in combination with continous basinal subsidence to the west. Deformation occured by flexure rather than faulting at this time (FigureIII.4). Permian salt is believed to have started to move in early 4Ar Cretaceous time and continued until Early Tertiary. (Figure 111.5).Stratigraphy and environment of deposition During the Lower Jurassic, the positive Sleipner structure aerial received sediments of subareal nature. In places these beds were eroded and Middle Jurassic sediments are resting on beds of Triassic age.', 'Passage_id': 434}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In Bajocian, conditions changed. The volcanic updoming related to the triple junction to the south, influenced sedimentation in the 15 quadrant. Erosional products from the volcanic province and the Utsira High were inter- mixed and transported in northward direction. During Bajocian, the sealevel raised and the environment of deposition changed from braided stream continental- paralic to deltaic/paralic shallow marine. The end of Bajocian was marked by temporary marine lowstand and deposition of extensive coalbeds took place in an inter- distributary bay/marsh environment.', 'Passage_id': 435}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: During Bathonian, the transgression continued and the invironment changed from deltaic to prodeltaic shallow marine. number of shoals, barriers, closed bays, lagoons and other clastic shoreline features were created by wave, stream and tidal action.

The Kimmerian Unconformity is reasonably good marker in the 15/5 block, but deteriorates eastwards into the 15/6 block. The top of the reservoir is not mappable from the present data. The base of the reservoir, however, is tied to the Red Marker (Top of Bajocian deltaics). It is reasonable good reflector on the north and west flank of the 15/5-1 structure, but gets discontinuous climbing up on the high.', 'Passage_id': 446}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Migration of the map is done manually by using the unmigrated map and calculating the migration effect on dipline. This effect as function of the dip is then applied on the whole map. The method is not accurate, but gives the order of magni- tude of the migration effect. The area of closure is reduced by approximately 20% by applying this method.- Preliminary velocity data (final velocity data is not yet available) from 15/5-1 and velocity data from 15/6-2 down to the Kimmerian Unconformity have been used to construct the geological cross sections in depth which are used for the reservoir model. Reservoirs of-15/5-1 deposit The hydrocarbon reservoir sediments in the 15/5-1 are formed by sands of Bajocian to Callovian age.', 'Passage_id': 447}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The particular 15/5-1 Jurassic reservoir sands can be split into two units, one lower coal-bearing sand of Bajocian age representing prograding deltaic sequence with delta plain/marsh sequence marking the top of the unit. The base of this unit is more question- able as one might speculate if the delta is resting on Lower Jurassic or Triassic or perhaps even sediments of the Middle Jurassic Pentland Formation type (red to green silt and shales). The second and upper sand unit on top of the deltaics represents transgressive period and consists of shore- line deposits of Bathonian to Callovian age. Because of continous reworking of these later sands, age-dating is difficult as the 15/5-1 well penetrated Callovian sediments which were to large extent reworked Batilonian.

Two possible models are considered: A. The sand is onlarping eastwards across the axis of the 15/5-1 and 15/6-2 structure, and the crest of the 15/5-1 structure was hingeline during deposition, and east of this line the sand has an even thickness, while to the west it is thickening down flank. The closure is in this case defined by the structural closure as mapped today. This is the model on which we have based our reserve estimate:.', 'Passage_id': 449}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/5-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: B. One could however imagine pinchout (onlap) situation along the hingeline of the 15/5-1 structure extending northeast and 'outhward into the 15/6 block. Applying this alternative model, the 15/5-1 deposit may not be defined by the structural closure as mapped today. A westward thickening of the reservoir and possible shaleout in the basin could make stratigraphic trap of considerable size. Further geological and geo- physical study will be made to evaluate this concept.

SIGNIFICANCE OF SLEIPNER FIELD ON DEVELOPMENT OF THE 15/5-1 DISCOVERY Our present assumption is that the 15/5-1 accumulation probably is too small to be developed alone even in an optimistic assumption as regards hydrocarbons in place. For commercial development we therefore believe that it would be dependent on the availability of main production and transportation system in the vicinity.
