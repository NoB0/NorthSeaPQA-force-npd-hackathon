Section 1.1.5 deals with the alternatives that exist and from this superficial examination, it is probable that the single leg jack-up concept, with pre-commissioned topside equipment installed over predrilled template would be comparable in cost. a. Influence of Method of Installation Barge launching the structure on location is the conventional method of installation, followed by controlled flooding to up- right the structure and final sinking to the seabed. If such a method is adopted, at least one face of the structure must have two parallel lauch tracks, and strong launch truss must be incorporated internally. This implies that at least legs must be used arranged in two rows of 4. The major disadvantage of such an eight-leg structure is that the wave force attracted are larger than for more open four legged structure . This is only true, however, if provision for installation is not considered and for heavier structures. The conventional North Sea approach has been to build large self-floating legs, which attract considerable extra wave force, (e.g. Thistle, Ninian, Magnus) or fabricate purpose built floa- taion rafts, which can be submerged with the structure atta- ched (e.g. Froties). The Forties system is not now favoured because of the lack of resuability of the floatation rafts and in each case, considerable extra problems of fabrication are introduced. The most complex and time consuming fabrication for self-floating jackets is for the floatation legs on the ground,,and this must be substantially complete before the main jacket structure can be built. This.complicatps and extends the fabrication process. A four legged structure without provision for installation will generally weight less because of the reduced wave forces and more open structure. It is not as redundant as an eight legged'\n",
