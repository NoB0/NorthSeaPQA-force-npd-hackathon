Section 1.1.5 deals with the alternatives that exist and from this superficial examination, it is probable that the single leg jack-up concept, with pre-commissioned topside equipment installed over predrilled template would be comparable in cost. a. Influence of Method of Installation Barge launching the structure on location is the conventional method of installation, followed by controlled flooding to up- right the structure and final sinking to the seabed. If such a method is adopted, at least one face of the structure must have two parallel lauch tracks, and strong launch truss must be incorporated internally. This implies that at least legs must be used arranged in two rows of 4. The major disadvantage of such an eight-leg structure is that the wave force attracted are larger than for more open four legged structure . This is only true, however, if provision for installation is not considered and for heavier structures. The conventional North Sea approach has been to build large self-floating legs, which attract considerable extra wave force, (e.g. Thistle, Ninian, Magnus) or fabricate purpose built floa- taion rafts, which can be submerged with the structure atta- ched (e.g. Froties). The Forties system is not now favoured because of the lack of resuability of the floatation rafts and in each case, considerable extra problems of fabrication are introduced. The most complex and time consuming fabrication for self-floating jackets is for the floatation legs on the ground,,and this must be substantially complete before the main jacket structure can be built. This.complicatps and extends the fabrication process. A four legged structure without provision for installation will generally weight less because of the reduced wave forces and more open structure. It is not as redundant as an eight legged'\n",

Job Summary 32 30 conductor casing The 36 hole was drilled to TD at 229 MD. The conductor was cemented from the shoe at 229 MD and back to the mudline at 154m MD. Prior to the job there was discussion on compressive strength development of conductor cement slurries. Several options were discussed, but the job was conducted with single 15.80ppg cement slurry. 200% excess volume was used. The cement slurry was displaced with 55bbls seawater at an average displacement rate of 5.7bpm. No problems were reported during the job. 20 13 3/8 casing A 17 1/2 hole was drilled to 1091 MD. The 20 13 3/8 casing was run to 1076 m MD and cemented by pumping 703bbls 13.2ppg lead slurry, and 159bbls 15.80ppg tail slurry. 100 % excess on open hole was used for volume calculations. The cement slurries were displaced with seawater at an average rate of 12.6bpm with the rig pumps. During the cement job there was trouble with the bulk system leading to stops in the cement delivery to the mixing unit several times during the job. Non-continuos cement delivery makes it difficult for the cementer to keep constant density on the cement slurry. Due to incorrect use of the cement head, the releasing dart did not go. Thus, the SSR top plug was never sheared and the cement was displaced without top wiper plug, leaving no barrier between the cement slurry and the displacement fluid (seawater). The casing was pressure tested to 1500psi (52 hours after the cement job). The pressure test was acceptable. In the following drill out phase, the cement was tagged at 1057 MD (11 below the float collar). The shoe / float collar was drilled out with rock bit with tons W.O.B. and 95 rpm (Drill out time = 1/2 hours). A LOT was performed to ppg after drilling out the shoe track.\", 'Passage_id': 1}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/8-10 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Plug across 13 3/8 shoe Well Report.. Cementing The objective of this job was to set balanced plug in the 13 3/8 shoe for sidetracking the well. The planned plug interval was 1244m MD to 1026m MD. The 13 3/8 tail slurry was utilized for the purpose. Since OBM was present in the well, 32bbls of Spacer-500E+ was pumped ahead of the 97bbls cement slurry. Load tested the plug after 20 hours. The top of the plug was verified at 1061 MD, lower than anticipated. Consider to use higher open hole excess volume on similar job in the future. No other problems reported. 9 5/8 production casing The 1/2 hole was drilled to 1890 MD and the 5/8 casing was run to 1875 m MD. The cement job was conducted by pumping 50bbls base oil, 50bbls 13.4ppg Spacer-500E+ ahead of 57 bbl cement slurry. 30 % OH excess was used in the volume calculations, with theoretical TOC = 1400 MD. Displaced the cement slurry with 9.5ppg brine. Pressure tested the casing to 5000psi 24 hours after the cement job. Pressure test acceptable.

The PTA program implemented:  Squeezing the perforations through cement retainer and setting 100m plug on top of the cement retainer.  Setting 200m balanced plug inside the production casing where the casing crossed over into the 5/8 casing.  Isolating the 13 3/8 shoe with cement plug and cement retainer.  Setting 200m balanced surface plug. No problems were reported on any of the following jobs. Squeeze perforations and spot plug on top of retainer: An EZSV cement retainer was set at +/- 1625 m. The perforations (1 m) were closed by squeezing 15.80ppg cement slurry with moderate fluid loss properties through the retainer. 12 bbl of cement were squeezed into the formations and 14 bbl were left inside the casing below the retainer. Stung out of the retainer and set 100 balanced plug (12 bbl on top of the retainer, giving TOC at 1525 m. bbl of fresh water spacer was pumped ahead of and behind the cement slurry. An acceptable pressure test and load test was performed after cement had set (WOC time: hrs). Test pressure was 1000psi, the plug was then tagged at 1540 MD and load tested with 10 tons. Plug #2 (1 m): A 200 balanced plug was set inside the casing with TOC just below the 5/8 casing cutting point. The job was performed pumping 24.5bbls 16.0ppg cement slurry. Fresh water was used as spacer (5bbls ahead and bbl behind). Before pulling out of the hole, the brine in the well was displaced with 11.0ppg OBM (11.0ppg OBM remained behind the casing).', 'Passage_id': 3}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 17/6-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Project overview Well(s): 17/6-1 Location Norway Total depth All depths are RKB/MD as given on samples.

This is probably result from the drilling of the casing cement. The sample is however fairly rich in Deflandrea oebisfeldensis, dinocyst species that has its main distribution in the Balder Formation. It may also be common in the upper Sele Formation and it may further be present in the basal part of the Hordaland Gp. The low pollen content in this sample is however not in accordance with the Balder and the Sele Formations, and hence the basal part of the Horda Fm (early Early Eocene) is considered most likely Recovery and preservation: Poor organic recovery and mixed assemblages due to content of casing cement.

Palynology comments: The sample yielded superabundant Deflandrea oebisfeldensis, dinocyst species that has its main distribution in the Balder Formation. It may also be common in the upper Sele Formation and it may further present in the basal part of the Hordaland Gp. The high pollen content, especially of Caryapollenites spp. in this sample is strongly associated with the Balder and the Sele Formations. Cerodinium wardenense has its main distribution in the lower part of the Balder Fm., and it may penetrate the upper SeleFm. The acme in Pterospermella spp., large forms is closely associated with the upper Sele Fm, biozone TP5b1.

The income of common calcareous benthonic foraminifera at 805m may suggest some decrease in water depth from above. Stratigraphic comment: The interval is attributed to the lower Lista Fm. This will say that the majority of the Sele Fm. and the upper Lista Fm/Heimdal equivalent should be present between 775m and the next sample above at 745m. We suspect an unconformity in the spacing between these two samples. The lithostratigraphic correspondence of the TP3a zone (830-860m) is problematic. In the type well for the Vle Fm., Norwegian well 1/3-1, the TP3a zone is clearly present from the top of the Vle Fm. In the Danish sector the zone is located in the lower Lista Fm., the Vile Mbr., and since the latter seems to be generally accepted in regionally simplified lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic correlation, we tentatively leave the zone within the Lista Fm.', 'Passage_id': 6}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 17/6-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 1312dcs CP9b Ellipsoidictyum imperfectum glabrum LO Stratigraphic comment: Undifferentiated Cromer Knoll Gp. from client interpretation. The sample at 1287m provides first downhole biostratigraphic evidence for an Early Cretaceous age, the age of the interval may suggest presence of Rdby Fm. The Middle and the Early Albian are not positively identified. Beds of these ages may be thin or missing between 1312 and 1338m. Micropaleontology comments: Microfauna composed of planktonic foraminifera, calcareous benthonic foraminifera, agglutinated forms, radiolaria and Inoceramus prisms, with increase in agglutinated forms in the lowermost sample at 1312m. No forms restricted to Early Cretaceous are noted in the uppermost sample at 1287m, the sample at 1312m include the LO of Textularia ?bettenstaedti which is consistent with the Early Cretaceous age assigned from palynology. Palynology comments: The LO in Apteodinium grande at 1287m, and the subsequent LO of Odontochitina singhii and acme in at 1312m, indicate the presence of fairly complete Late Albian interval. Additional observations like common Cribroperidinium edwardsii and Oligosphaeridium complex, and abundant Surculosphaeridium longifurcatum, are considered good support for the penetration of the Early Cretaceous Late Albian.

The following were, however, noted: - The DEN/NEU separation in the oil zone is higher than theoretically expected. This is seen in both the 12 1/4 and in the %2 section. - The resistivity curves are noisy for high values of resistivity indicating that the tool is close to the upper limit of the tool. - In the same formation and fluid (Garn oil zone) the resistivity from the 12  section  P28H_UNC from ARC is reading significantly lower than P34H_UNC from ARC in the %2 section. Raw curves are listed in Table 4-1. 3.2 Composite curves The composites curves (and evaluation curves) are listed in Table 4-2 were details about splice depths, depth shifting and editing are found. The composite curves were created from LWD curves in both the %2 and in the 12 1/4 section. 3.3 Processing The processing was done according to the Heidrun Evaluation model as of 2003. Well specific parameters are listed in Table 3-1 The quality of the evaluation curves (QUAL_FLAG) were defined as medium in this well mainly based on the uncertainties associated with the raw curves as mentioned in section 3.1. In the gas zone there is additional uncertainties in the evaluation due to uncertainty associated with mud invasion effects. Due to the differences in resistivity responses in the 12 1/4 and in the %2 section the calculated water saturation Sw becomes quite different in the two sections.

The resistivity log is corrected for borehole conditions and both Apparent Resistivity (RSAX) and Corrected Resistivity (RSCX) are presented on the log. The Gamma Detector is Scintillation device, calibrated to API units. The Computerized Directional Sensor (CDS) provides directional surveys (Toolface, Azimuth and Inclination) and downhole circulating temperature. DUAL PROPAGATION RESISTIVITY (DPR) TOOL The Dual Propagation Resistivity (DPR) tool comprises of resistivity sensor which measures resistivity by emitting MHz electromagnetic wave into the formation. This wave is monitored by the two receiving antennaes, spaced apart, hence giving outstanding bed definition. The sensor measures the Phase Difference (PD) and Amplitude Ratio (AR) for the wave, which are transformed mathematically into resistivity values. The two resistivity measurements have different depths of investigation. The Amplitude Ratio Resistivity (PAR) reads deepest into the formation, while Phase Difference Resistivity (RPD) is the most accurate at high resistivities and offers the best vertical resolution. The tool also includes Computerized Directional Sensor (CDS) giving directional surveys (Toolface, Azimuth and Inclination) and downhole circulating temperature. The Scintillation Gamma ray detector is calibrated to the MWD-API standard. In addition, the tool features downhole memory, which samples data every six seconds. The sampling time is programmable and can be changed on the rig. Realtime data is transmitted to the surface. When the DPR tool is raised above the RKB, the memory is dumped and the data processed in order to produce high quality log with excellent definition and detail. Hence the DPR tool provides both real-time data (Measurement-While Drilling, MWD data) and memory data (Recorded While Drilling, RWD data).

The pressure pulse is generated by piston moving towards valve seat, temporarily restricting the flow and causing pressure increase. There are at the moment two ways of transmitting the binary (ones and zeros) stream of digits to the surface. BIPHASE CODE The transmitted data consists of stream of binary digits (ones and zeros). Each bit takes certain length of time, one data cell width, to transmit. Independent of the data rate, bit is represented by a level change (valve motion) at the start of the bit. bit has level change at the start and middle of the bit. Consequently each bit requires either one or two movements by the piston. The Biphase code performs well under difficult decoding conditions. MILLER CODE Miller code is an alternative to Biphase code. It requires less valve motions to transmit the same number of bits. This means that the transmission frequency can be lowered, while the data rate is maintained. With Miller x4M we get the same valve movement as with the X2 Biphase, but twice as much data is transmitted to the surface. is presented by level change in the middle of the bit. has no level change, unless it is followed by another 0, in which case there is level change at the end of the first bit period. SPLITPHASE CODE New generation Teleco MWD tools will have the ability to be programmed for splitphase code. This is new method of data transmission that allows the same high data rate as the Miller code, while being more robust and allowing more signal noise. With splitphase is represented by negative going level change in the middle of the bit, while is represented by positive going level change (pressure rise) in the middle of the bit. 4.11.4 TIME PER DATA BIT FOR THE DIFFERENT CODES X2 BIPHASE X3 BIPHASE X4 MILLER X6 MILLER X4 SPLITPHASE X6 SPLITPHASE (X2B) (X3B) (X4M) (X6M) (X4 S) (X6S) 2.50 sec/bit 1.67 sec/bit 1.25 sec/bit 0.83 sec/bit -2-', 'Passage_id': 22}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/6-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: TELECD EQUIPMENT PERFORMANCE REPORT COMPANY: SAGA LOCATION: TREASURE SAGA JOB NO: NOR 434 WELL NO: 25/6-2 9 7/8 PILOT HOLE, 36 HOLE OPENING AND 17 1/2 PILOT HOLE DHB 8404-10 (DPR X4S) accumulated circulating hours but due to the low flow rates being used the tool was unable to gain sufficient power from the turbine alternator to adequately power up the electronics.

The well position is on the Utsira High, west of the main fault in the southern part of the block. The well was drilled vertically, with surveys provided by Teleco MWD tools. For the 36 and 17 1/2 pilot hole sections an 1/4 DPR tool was used. For the 17 1/2 hole, 1/4 RGD tools were used. In the 12 1/4 hole DPR service was requested, but Teleco took the opportunity to demonstrate the 1/4 Modular Triple Combo tool that included Neutron Porosity and Density in addition to DPR. Please see the Tool Definition report for further details on the tool types. 9 7/8 PILOT FOR 36 HOLE 145m - 370m RUN # 1. 145m - 196m ROTARY HOLD ASSY The well was spudded with 7/8 BHA comprising of Hughes ATJIS bit with 3x20 nozzles, bit sub, nm p/p sub, MWD, saver sub, monel, DC 11, jar, DC 3, x/o and HWDP 1. The Teleco DPR tool No.8404-10 (450-900 GPM) was picked up and verified at surface before the assembly was run in hole without marine riser and BOP. Started spudding with very little flow, around GPM. This was too little to get good log while drilling. When taking surveys, the same problem occurred. The tool sent just numbers for gamma and resistivity readings. This is clear indication of insufficient flow rate, as the tool does not power up the logging sensors. Due to problems with washing out the hole with an increased flowrate, it was decided by Saga representative to pull out to change the Teleco tool. Two directional surveys were taken during this run, showing an inclination of degrees at the end. The tool accumulated 2.1 circulating hours. RUN # 196m - 370m ROTARY HOLD ASSY After changing the Teleco tool to DPR No.2266-22, the assembly was run in hole and the spudding continued from 196m. Same decoding problems, caused by insufficient flowrate, was encountered by this tool as well. After the Saga representative agreed to increase the flowrate to around 500 GPM, decoding problems were no longer causing problems, other than when taking surveys. -1-', 'Passage_id': 25}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/6-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Several tries to get the correct FID was necessary. The bad decoding experienced was probably caused by the pressure drop in standpipe when pulling the bit off bottom when taking the surveys. In order to get high enough SPP to get survey flowrate of 610 GPM was needed. This was the highest flowrate that could be used before washing out the hole. Even with these flowrates the first three of total of surveys, failed to give correct FID, and had to be taken over again. These problems were not encountered below 236m. The realtime log suffered from the lack of appropriate flow and several passages with too high ROP. An excellent memory log, which showed possible shallow gas area around 274m, was produced and presented to the customer. total of directional surveys were taken throughout the run with final inclination of degrees and direction of 136.2 degrees. The tool accumulated circulating hours. 36 HOLE SECTION 145m - 258m 145m - 258m 36 HOLE OPENER For the 36 hole opening 26 bit was placed before the holeopener and the same Teleco tool as the previous run. The MWD was utilized mainly to check the well path and to avoid possible kick-off. The realtime log produced was of good quality, but showed more trends than actual value due to the large hole diameter. The readings actually reflected seawater more than true formation. A total of directional surveys were taken during this run with final inclination of degrees and azimuth of degrees at 245m. The tool accumulated circulating hours. 258m - 1045m ROTARY HOLD ASSY After running the 30 casing, riser and SBD (seabed diverter) were installed prior to drilling ahead. The cement and shoe was drilled out with 26 bit and underreamer. 17 1/2 assembly was built comprising of a: REED MS13G bit with lx17, 3x22 nozzles, bit sub w/float, x/o, nm p/p sub, MWD, saver sub, monel, x/o, 17 1/2 stab, x/o, DC, x/o, 17 1/2 stab, x/o, DC 12, jar, DC 3, x/o, HWDP 1, Dart sub and HWDP x 9. The same Teleco tool No. 2266-22 was used in this pilot hole. The tool was not tested on surface on Saga's request. The assembly was run in hole and tagged bottom at 261m. Commenced drilling with flowrate between GPM with SPP of 2 psi. The WOB varied between - 15 tonnes while the RPM stayed between . These parameters gave an average ROP of in/hr of this run. Wiper trips to the 30 casing shoe was performed at 545m and 817m. TD of the pilot hole was set to 1045m. The hole was circulated clean prior to pulling out to open the hole to 26. total of 28 directional surveys were taken throughout this run showing very steady inclination with final of degrees and with an azimuth of 86.7 degrees at 1037m.

The hole was opened to 26 without any incidents, and the riser and seabed diverter were pulled in preparation to run the 20 casing. During this operation gas bubbles were seen at the seabed by the ROV camera, and corrective action had to be taken. Ran the drill string back to bottom and established circulation, and the mudweight was increased in steps up to SG. The 20 casing was set at 1030m, and the BOP and riser were installed prior to starting to drill. 1045m - 1388m PENDULUM ASSEMBLY Made up rotary drop assembly, comprising of 17 1/2 Smith SS44J4 rockbit with lx16 and 3x18 nozzles, the Teleco RGD tool (SN 8414-5), and 17 1/2 stabilizer placed 23.11m above the bit. The Teleco tool was tested to specification at the first HWDP. Ran in to the top of the cement at 1015m, and drilled cement and float to 1030m. The hole was displaced to SG KCL mud prior to drilling the shoe and cleaning out the rat hole. Drilled another 5m of fresh formation to 1051m and circulated and conditioned the mud prior to performing the LOT, which gave EQMW. This was sufficient to continue drilling. The mudweight was increased while drilling, in preparation of the forthcoming pore-pressure rise. Drilling resumed using the following drilling parameters: 137 RPM, 865 GPM, 10-15 tonnes WOB, at 2300 psi, and gave an ROP between 15 - 25 in/hr. The decoding under these conditions were 100% efficient, and good formation log was recorded. To maintain the rate of penetration the WOB had to be increased to 20 tonnes at 1169m, and accordingly the flow adjusted up to 1000 GPM to optimize hole cleaning. The following surveys showed an inclination build rate, and gave deg at 1271m. Several adjustments were carried out, the WOB was decreased to 5-10 tonnes and the RPM increased to 170. The alterations had limited effects, the angle still showed gradual build and gave maximum reading of deg at 1328m. With the increasing angle the well path direction started to align to around 220-230 deg. The high possibility of missing the first target at 2096m with the present inclination build up rate, led to the decision to POOH at 1388m. The hole packed off at 1363m, resulting in total loss of circulation. Circulation was re-established and the string was backreamed to the 20 casing shoe. Circulated and rotated inside the casing in an attempt to free the string for attached gumbos. Ran back in hole and circulated bottoms up prior to POOH.

This angle built to deg at 1428m and further to deg at 1457m. Lower WOB was tried in order to drop angle but to no avail. Throughout the run the angle kept building until the final survey at 1599m which showed an angle of deg. The direction varied between 227.4 deg and deg, corrected to grid north. At 1609m it was decided to pull out of hole to make up motor assembly in order to drop angle.  RUN #  1609m - 1911m MOTOR ASSEMBLY A correction run had to be performed, so motor assembly was built.

The Teleco tool was not tested on surface on Sagas request. Ran in hole to 1570m, and washed down to bottom. Drilled ahead in alternating steering and rotating mode, using drilling parameters as: 1000 GPM, 10-20 tonnes WOB, 60 surface RPM, giving stand-pipe pressure of 3700 psi. To avoid key-seatings the plan was to turn the well path and control the drop rate, by keeping the toolface around 120 deg R. Some problems were experienced during steering, it was difficult to maintain the optimum toolface region, due to frequent limestone stringers. The actual toolface range during drilling were around deg R, and the well path direction gradually turned to the right while the inclination dropped off as desired. The survey taken at 1698m survey depth gave an inclination of deg and an azimuth of 251.3. Drilling resumed and the angle continued to drop and gave deg at 1780m survey depth. The recorded azimuths varied bit more, due to the relatively low angle. A wiper trip to the shoe was performed at 1800m, and no tight spots were experienced when POOH.

Tagged the cement at 1999m. Drilled out the cement, float, shoe and cleaned out the rathole down to 2050m. The new formation was drilled down to 2053m prior to performing the LOT to SG. Resumed drilling with drilling parameters: WOB 10 - 25 tonnes, RPM around 180, Flowrate between GPM with SPP from 0 psi. At 2091m sudden pressure increase of some 600 psi occurred, and the tool stopped pulsing. Continued drilling, and after about 70m the tool started pulsing again with very small pulses. It is most likely, the pulser valve of the tool had been blocked by some debris. This debris was then probably washed away, to some extent, as drilling continued. This is substantiated by the fact that complete memory log was obtained over this section. There was no problem decoding these pulses, and good realtime log was obtained.

The section was completed in two runs to 370m. No wireline logs were run, and the MWD log was accepted as the final log of the section. The pilot hole was then opened to 36 with the same tool from 145m to 258m. TOOL PERFORMANCE: Due to low flowrate (425-470 gpm), tool No. 8404-10 had problems getting initiated and was laid down after drilling down to 196m. The tool gave very few datapoints due to the low flowrate, and no continuous log was obtained from 145-194m. Tool No. 2266-22 gave very good memory log down to TD of the pilot section at 368m (sensor depth). Also with this tool the flowrate was occasionally low and gave small gaps in the realtime log. The data density on the real-time log was poor at some intervals due to very high ROPs as well. LOGGING CONDITIONS: The 7/8 pilot hole section was drilled without marine riser and BOP-stack. Drilling fluid used was seawater with MW = SG, supplied with high-visc. pills. The ROP stayed between 20 - 100 m/hr throughout the section. The formation consisted mostly of claystone interbedded with sandstone stringers.

It must be noted that the flowrates used during drilling 970-990 GPM, were higher than the specified setup of the tool turbine, and were not recommended by Teleco engineers on site. These precautions are set in order to prevent excessive turbine wear, and thus prolong the lifetime of the tool. The 17 1/2 pilot hole section commenced at 216m, and was drilled with a SG Gel-Mud. As mentioned above the prime objective of the logging service was to distinguish whether gas sands were present, and a few interesting features must be noted. When drilling the 7/8 pilot hole possible gas sand was logged at 274m, with resistivity response of ohm-m. The 17 1/2 pilot hole section was drilled several days later and thus the already drilled formation down to 370m had been opposed to mud invasion. When relogging the section the resistivity spike at 273m was confirmed, but did not clearly identify the presence of gas. The sand stringer in question indicated now that the formation fluid was water. The sand had probably been invaded by the conductive mud, and gave more typical thin bed response where low resistivity spike is followed by high resistivity spike. The following high resistivity might also have been a shoulder bed effect. Other thin bed responses can be seen at 340m and 525m The sand stringer at 478-479m gave doubtful resistivity response, the peak might indicate gas, but it could also be that the sand is harder at the bottom. The ROP was at all times controlled and does not quite reflect the formation changes. The Saga Geologists at the site did not fully exclude the possibilities of the presence of shallow gas, but no positive gas horizons were seen on the MWD log. No significant gas peaks were recorded by Geoservices, but this might be due to approximately SG overbalance in mudweight, when comparing to the calculated pore-pressure. The separation of the two resistivity curves in the clay sequences are due the dielectric constants of the formations. The tool's memory was downloaded and an excellent RWD log was produced and given to Saga. -2-\", 'Passage_id': 32}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/6-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: S  Four bit runs were required to complete the hole section, and all assemblies comprised of the same Teleco RGD tool. separate set of wireline logs were run at section TD, and number of sidewall core samples were taken. The RGD-RAW tool (S/N 8414-5) performed to specification throughout the section. high data density MWD log was recorded, and given to the Saga representatives. The log gave clear picture of the formation changes, and correlated excellent to wireline logs taken in the offset well. Drilled out the 20 casing shoe with pendulum assembly, with the Teleco MWD tool placed 1.69m behind the bit. Prior to penetrating the shoe the hole had been displaced to SG KCL mud, and accordingly the gamma ray trace on the log had to be corrected for the potassium content in the mud. LOT was taken and the pressure obtained in the formation below the shoe was sufficient to commence drilling. The log confirmed the casing shoe depth at 1030m, and the 26 rathole down to 1045m which are reflected by the lower gamma and resistivity values. Drilled through the Hordaland formation with controlled rate of penetration of 20-30 m/hr through the predominant claystone lithology, and with drillbreaks up to 50 m/hr in the occasional sand and sandstone layers. Traces of Limestone were seen in the cuttings, but the thin stringers were not picked up by the MWD 16 Short Normal resistivity device. The Balder formation was encountered at 1925m, and can be seen on the log by gradual declining gamma and an increasing resistivity trend. From 1963m the gamma values rose steadily and marked the transition into the Sele formation at 1975m, where the gamma ray levelled at 50-60 MWD-API. The resistivity trace on the log didn't clearly identify this transition, but stabilized at lower level around ohm-m (R corr). Drilled down to prognosed 2050m with no major problems. Tight holes were encountered in sections due to the hydrating properties of the Claystone. Borehole diameter and mud resistivity corrections have been applied to the resistivity (R corr) trace on the log. Under the present logging conditions the factors applied are just under the acceptable limits for the type of tool in use, causing the large separation between corr and app due to the high salinity of the mud. -3-\", 'Passage_id': 33}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/6-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: For this section Modular tool No. 866-40 was utilized. This is field test of an 1/4 triple combination tool. This tool measures and transmit Neutron Porosity and Formation Density in addition to the normal services the DPR tool gives. The hole was logged with wireline after the drilling was completed. Included in the well report are DPR logs only. At the time of performing this field test algorithms for an 8 1/4 Neutron Porosity and Density tool were not available. Porosity logs are calculated in Connecticut and will be given to Saga later. After hours the tool was partially plugged, and stopped transmitting realtime data. Drilling continued, and after about 70m the tool started transmitting again. The pulses were very small but very good realtime log was obtained. The missing sequence was relogged during wiper trip, and realtime log was produced for the hole section. The memory log was recorded during the missing transmission as the turbine was working. Therefore memory log was obtained for the hole section, and presented to the customer. This section was drilled with SG. KCL-mud. The KCL content was kept at around 40 ppb. During drilling the ROP varied between - 30 m/hr which gave an excellent realtime and memory log.

The assembly experienced difficulty steering in the under pressured Heimdal formation and the penetration rate was low and after 37 hours on bottom it dropped to zero. Another rock bit of the same type as the previous one was run in order to drop the angle before the penetration of the Shetland limestone. In order to avoid fault the well was also steered to the west. The drilling rate was low in the hard formation and the low gas levels experienced reflect both this and the relatively high overbalance with which it was drilled. The final run of the section utilised PDC bit on rotary steerable assembly with an Anadrill PowerDrive tool. The tool was used to ensure that the near vertical well stayed on target, rather than for drilling deviated well. The section TD was called on cuttings returns, in claystone, below the massive Shetland limestone sequence. Rates of penetration were higher than with the preceding rock bits, but gas values remained low. The 10 3/4 / 5/8 casing was run without incident and minimal losses were observed during the cementing. A rotary assembly with PDC bit was used to drill out the 5/8 shoe and formation integrity test was carried out to 1.90sg after drilling 4m of new formation. The assembly did tend to build angle as the well was extended through the reservoir, but remained within target tolerances. ROPs were low in the hard formation and this eventually forced bit trip within 200m of the expected well TD. The same assembly with an extra stand of drill collars was used in the final run with different PDC bit to extend the well 165m to TD of 4004m MD (3909.2m TVD), which is approximately 174m below the base of the producing zone.

In addition, one litre bottle of mud were taken at the start of mudlogging in each section and at casing points or whenever major changes to the mud system. Further, one geochemical gas-bag sample were taken every 40 metre from 3520m MD to 4000m MD. Lithological analysis of the cuttings was conducted at the wellsite using binocular microscope and an ultraviolet light source. The interpreted lithology is based on cuttings-lithology and drilling parameters such as ROP, WOB, torque, gas levels and MWD-logs.

Dropping the hole angle was priority in the section above the Shetland group. The assembly experienced difficulty steering and ROPs were low in both rotary and oriented drilling. The high overbalance whilst drilling the under pressured Heimdal formation was contributory to the poor performance. Gas levels remained low throughout the run and no connection gases were recorded. When pulling off bottom the jars were frequently operated, possibly as result of differential sticking, although ledges from the numerous limestone stringers is also conceivable.

Connection gas can be used effectively as quantitative measurement as it is considered that its presence indicates that pore pressure is within 35 bar of the drilling fluids hydrostatic pressure. 2) Hole conditions: Tightness, drag and fill can be used as qualitative indications of abnormal pore pressure. 3) Cavings appearance: Spalling cavings is good indicator of higher pore pressure than the hydrostatic pressure from the drilling fluid. 4) Flow line temperature: A qualitative indicator which, can display rapid increases on entering over-pressured zones. 5) Modified Dc Exponent: The modified drilling exponent (Dxc) can be used to calculate pore pressures in claystones using Eaton's formula. Having established trend line for normal pore pressure, i.e. increasing with depth as the formation drillability decreases due to normal compaction, any cutbacks away from the trendline whilst drilling claystone indicate increasing pore pressure. It is important to note that Dc Exponent cannot be used to evaluate pore pressure when rate of penetration is being held back for hole cleaning purposes and is inappropriate for use in lithologies other than claystone.\", 'Passage_id': 50}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/4-C-1 H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: PORE PRESSURE EVALUATION WHILST DRILLING Please note that all depths are in TVD. PROGNOSIS Estimation based on data from correlation wells indicates normal pore pressure down to 1405 m. At 1405 the pore pressure is expected to increase from hydrostatic to sg at 1650 m. The pore pressure gradient then decreases through Hordaland towards hydrostatic at approximately 1900 m. Due to regional depletion one can expect subnormal pressure in Frigg and also in Heimdal sands if present. Any hydrocarbons present in these sands will be balanced by seawater if depleted. The pore pressure will increase gradually from hydrostatic at top Lista or possibly earlier, in mid to base Sele and reach approximately sg in top Shetland. A steady pressure of sg is expected through the Shetland Group. sharp increase to sg is expected at the transition Shetland / Viking groups. The Viking / Brent transition is also characterised by sharp change in the pore pressure gradient. Theoretically the pressure in top Brent can be as high as sg (621 bar) as maximum. The pore pressure gradient is expected to drop towards the OWC and be around  sg (646 bar) at TD. 36 HOLE SECTION The 36 section was drilled without any riser with seawater and high viscous sweeps in one bit run from 140 to 202 m. No problems were encountered drilling this section. The exponent was erratic in throughout this section, so normal compaction trend line could not be set, but there was no indication of anything other than normal pore pressure of sg. 26 HOLE SECTION The 26 section was drilled in bit runs from 202 to 1214 m. The section was drilled with no returns to surface with seawater and viscous sweeps. The exponent was erratic in throught this section, so normal compaction trend line could not be set, but there was no indication of anything other than normal pore pressure of sg. 12 1/4 HOLE SECTION A 17 1/2 bit drilled out the cement, shoe and of new formation using seawater. LOT was performed to sg. The bottom hole assembly was changed to 12 1/4. The hole was displaced to sg Versa Vert oil based mud and the first bit drilled to 1336m, but was left in the hole. sidetrack was drilled in bitruns to 3413 mTVD. In the Hordaland Group the formation drilled consists of silty claystone and sand. The Rogaland Group consists of mainly sand with claystone stringers, and the Shetland Group consists of Limestone and calcerious claystone. The variations in formation resulted in erratic exponent indicating no trend. Gas levels were low with no connection gas and cavings. The increase of drilled gas at 3330 resulted from change in the formation. 8 1/2 HOLE SECTION The formations encountered in this hole section prevented the accurate establishment of normal D- exponent compaction trend for pressure prediction. No pressure cavings were observed during the drilling of the section. Gas peaks that were thought to be connection gas were investigated by performing pumps- off and swab tests. No gas peaks resulted. These peaks were attributed to minor coals picked from the cuttings analysis. The mud weight was raised from sg to sg in anticipation of the reservoir being penetrated 50m higher than prognosed.

The drilling fluid for the sections with returns to the surface was selected based on: 1. Salinity selection based on hydrate suppression calculation. 2. Inhibition based on laboratory tests performed on cuttings from the offset well drilled by Norsk Hydro in 1997. 3. Selection of lubricant/ROP enhancer based on results from the DEA 90 project tests on ROP improvement. 4. The mud had few components which were included for specific purpose. 5. The mud formulation had to have low formation damage potential. 6. The mud components would not interfere with show interpretation. The SFT, the state pollution authority, was given request to use the DRIL-N-SLIDE in the mud on this well and to discharge the mud to the sea as required. The discharge permit was granted with the following restrictions: 1. The level of the DRIL-N-SLIDE to be kept as low as possible to achieve our ROP goals in the 12 1/4 hole interval up to maximum content of 4%. 2. There would be no discharge of whole mud from the mud pits. 3. The SFT would be provided with report on the performance and how the restrictions were met. The KCl/NaCI PAC drilling fluid with to 4% DRIL-N-SLIDE content was selected for the intermediate and reservoir sections. The testing fluid requirements were more straight forward: 1. solids free, filtered brine (probably sodium chloride brine) was required. 2. The density requirements would be known after the obtaining pressure data from the logging. 3. kill pill would be required to kill the well at the end of the testing program. 4. All the fluids had to go through the sand control screens which had 200 micron openings. The sodium chloride brine was selected for the testing fluid and BARAPLUG (sized salt) kill pill which has been used on Ula/Gyda was selected for the kill pill.', 'Passage_id': 52}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6305/7-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: All these criteria were met and these factors were major contribution to the high core recovery on the very successful coring operation on this well. Testing: The well was cleaned up and displaced to filtered sodium chloride brine successfully. The successful test was carried out and the well was killed. There were indications that some plugging of the screens may have occurred. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE PROJECTS IN THIS AREA: 1. Riserless intervals: Alternative viscosifiers to bentonite should be considered if the deck load limitations are so close that there is insufficient time to allow the bentonite to yield. careful economic evaluation must be done to determine the most effective solution to be used. The use of bentonite extenders such as N-VIS HI should be examined and solutions to the foaming problem should be determined i.e. eliminate sources of air entrapment, mixing procedures, etc. 2. Intermediate and reservoir intervals: The restricted discharge of mud by the SFT caused 1803 bbl to be sent to Gyda for injection. In future wells the case should be brought to the attention of the environmental department at the first opportunity - at least months in advance of spud. Alternative more environmentally friendly lubricant/ROP enhancers should be evaluated by Baroid's & group. The same evaluation of mud types should be carried out on future wells as the second offset well (being drilled after this well) is experiencing hole stability problems with similar mud formulation (no DRIL-N-SLIDE). They feel it is density problem, so all offset data that is available should be used in the evaluation. 3. Testing interval: The testing went well and in the future evaluation and selection of kill pills should consider: a. It was noted that there was no sign of sand on the screens and this raises the question of whether sand control screens are absolutly necessary. b. BARAPLUG Fine should be used in future pills to ensure that all of the plugging particles will pass through the screens. The BARAPLUG has a small amount of particles in the 200+ micron range. c. Alternative kill fluids that could be used would be BARACARB (sized calcium carbonate). This fluid would be screened to remove large particles i.e. at least 150 mesh (100 micron) screens. 05-11-9\", 'Passage_id': 53}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6305/7-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: d. Another solution would be to kill the well with drilling mud that has been screened with at least mesh size of 150 (100 microns). Finer mesh screens would be recommended. e.

The planning that went into the design and use of the fluids on this well resulted in well that was drilled quickly, safely and with minimum of problems. All of the objectives were met.

Hole Section Objective : Displace the well to seawater, clean up the well and displace the well to filtered SG sodium chloride brine. Test the reservoir sand zone. Kill the well, pull the test string and P&A the well. Summary : The pits, mixing lines and transfer lines were thoroughly cleaned. 584 bbl new sodium chloride brine at SG was received from land and was filtered to 10 microns and 20 NTU. After filtration, the brine was diluted with drill water to SG. A pressure controlled displacement to seawater was done before the wash pills were pumped and the sodium chloride brine pill was displaced into the well. Due to the quick drop in NTU on the seawater while displacing out the mud, the wash pills were displaced with 600 bbl of seawater and then the filtered SG brine. When the brine displacement was started, the NTU on the seawater 20. 1800 bbl of SG mud was transfered to the supply boat during the displacement to seawater. No mud was stored on the rig during the test. The test was accomplished as per program. A 60 bbl kill pill was made up with saturated sodium chloride brine, N-DRIL HT, BARAPLUG and BARAPLUG Fine. The rheology was adjusted with small amounts of BARAZAN PLUS. An additional volume of SG sodium chloride brine was made up. 1615 bbl mud was received and was diluted with seawater to SG. The rheology of the mud was adjusted with BARAZAN PLUS. This was done in order to have enough volume for the killing operation. The contents of the tubing string was bled down to the flare and the circulating ports were opened. 1/2 times the tubing volume was reverse circulated with the SG sodium chloride brine. 40 bbl kill pill was spotted inside the tubing above the iris valve. One attempt was made to bullhead through the screens. Two bbl were bullheaded on this attempt. The circulating ports were opened and the remaining 38 bbl of the kill pill were displaced to the annulus. An attempt was made to bullhead the kill pill to annulus after the ports were closed and the test string was pulled out of the packer with no apparent injection to the perforations. When the gauges were recovered, it was found that the perforations were taking very small amount of fluid when bullheading the annulus. During the plug and abandonment operation, the perforations were bullheaded with mud and bbl of mud was injected to the formation. The tubing string and annulus were displaced to SG mud. The riser was displaced to SG KCl/NaCl/Polymer mud via the choke line. flow check was performed and the well was dead. The test string was pulled out of the hole with the annulus volume being circulated once. No gas was observed on this circulation.', 'Passage_id': 55}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6305/7-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Well Name: 6305/7-1 Geo Area: MCRE BASIN Interval Discussion The sand screens were covered by salt particles. There was some unsheared polymer material on the gauge housing below the sand screens. Lab analysis shows that there was no starch (N-DRIL HT) in the polymer. This polymer mass probably came from one of the high viscosity pills which had no N-DRIL HT content. This could have been caused by an unsheared volume of BARAZAN PLUS that settled to bottom or was in the wellhead when the test string was run in the hole. The kill pill was checked for fish eyes (unsheared polymer) constantly during the mixing of the pill. No fish eyes were observed during the mixing and none were found in the sample of the circulated kill pill sent to the Baroid lab. The kill pill sample particle size distribution (PSD) analysis showed that 90% of the kill pill particles were below 90 microns. Approximately 0.5% was greater than 191 microns. Analysis of the material plugging the bottom of the screens and of the material covering the screens indicated that the material collected after the screens were sent to town was sodium chloride (salt i.e BARAPLUG) with minor insoluble contaminants. After killing the well and the test string was pulled out of the hole. cement stinger of 3/8 tubing and 10 stands of 1/2 drill pipe was made up and run to 2945 meters. One string volume was circulated and no gas was found. The perforations were bullheaded one more time with mud. barrels of mud were injected through the perforations. 20 bbl fresh water spacer was pumped, followed by 55 bbl of cement slurry and bbl of spacer. This was displaced with 140 bbl of mud. There were no losses during cement job. The cement string was pulled back to 2466 meters which was approximately 100 meters over the theoretical top of the cement. The string volume was reverse circulated out. Just traces of cement were seen on bottoms up. good pressure test was performed to 2500 psi. The cement stinger was pulled out of the hole. A bridge plug was set in the 5/8 casing at 1090 meters. The 5/8 casing was successfully cut at meters and was pulled out of hole. cement plug was set meters above the bridge plug. The choke and kill lines and the riser were displaced to seawater at the maximum flow rate. 1618 bbl of SG mud was backloaded on to the Far Spirit for injection on the Gyda platform at later date. The DRILI-N-SLIDE content was 0.9% when back loading the mud. Density: The brine for testing had density of SG. The kill pill had density of SG. The well was displaced to SG KCl/NaCl/Pac mud when the well was killed. Mud properties : All mud properties was according to the specifications. Solids control : The four Derrick shakers were dressed with old screens. There were 14 mesh top screens on all four shale shakers. Two of the shale shakers were dressed with 125 mesh bottom screens, one was dressed with 100 mesh bottom screens and the last one was dressed with 84 mesh bottom screens. 29-10-9 BAROID Division of Baroid Corp', 'Passage_id': 56}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6305/7-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: S  Variances from mud program : The displacement to filtered brine began before the wash pills had reached the surface. 40 bbl of kill pill were pumped instead of 20 bbl. The kill pill plugged the perforations and possibly the sand screens during the killing operation. It was planned to plug only the perforations. The discharge permit permit called for no discharge of whole mud from the mud pits. MT of DRIL-N-SLIDE was left in the hole when the well was plugged and abandoned.

METHODS 2.1 Habitat Survey Procedures 2.1.1 Interpretation of Geophysical Data The side scan sonar data was thoroughly examined as each line was acquired in order to determine the presence and type of features present, and to gauge the general extent of any features of interest. Once 100% coverage of the Cooper survey site had been achieved the onboard environmental scientists were familiar with all facies present and confident as to which type should be investigated further, with particular focus on those thought to represent potential coral mounds. The side scan sonar data was then reviewed with preliminary bathymetric data to compare sonar features with topographic variations (see Error! Reference source not found.). Figure 2.1: Example Side Scan Sonar Signatures of Lophelia (See Figure for locations) A D E Distinct sonar data signatures were considered to correspond with the presence of the cold-water coral, Lophelia pertusa; which, according to the bathymetric data, occurred on the berms (sides) of iceberg ploughmarks (Figure 2.1); the distribution of these facies rarely appeared to be independent of iceberg ploughmarks. Iceberg ploughmarks were found to be prevalent throughout the site, and cold- water coral communities are known to favour the flanks of the ploughmarks due to the greater exposure to food-bearing water currents. Areas of coarse material were generally associated with the edges of the many iceberg plough marks, indicative of hard substratum suitable for colonisation by Lophelia pertusa. The mottled patches with shadowing in the sonar data were thought to indicate coral pinnacles, while the ellipsoidal forms of generally lower reflectivity were thought to correspond to older, degraded fringes of the coral mounds (Figure 2.1). All such facies within the Cooper site were delineated and mapped from the 100% side scan sonar mosaic, and later reviewed against mosaics composed of only even lines and only odd lines. The delineated areas were then reviewed and FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 11', 'Passage_id': 76}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/11-9 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: discussed with the onboard geophysicist and the Client representative to ensure the side scan sonar data had been interpreted appropriately and as accurately as possible (See Figure for example delineations, and Figure for the locations of these examples). All areas of potential coral were then mapped together with the original proposed drill locations (Alternative and Alternative 2), proposed anchor positions and the Alternative anchor chain pattern. A 500 radius was displayed for each proposed drill location, and 60 radius was placed over each Alternative anchor location in order to identify areas of potential coral that may occur close to the proposed developments. 500 radius is considered the appropriate zone of seabed that may be potentially and directly influenced by impacts from smothering and / or contamination during drilling, while the 60 radius zones around each proposed anchor location were placed on the advice of Acona Wellpro (personal communications), to determine any corals present which may be at risk from mechanical damage during anchor deployment. 2.1.2 Survey Strategy A total of 22 camera transects and stationary drop-down deployments were selected to ground-truth all sediments present and provide sufficient data to contrast with the delineated boundaries of the mapped areas of coral (Figure 2.2). All sampling was carried out as proposed. The transects were typically positioned to run parallel to or perpendicular to the sides of iceberg ploughmarks in order to adequately delineate potential coral aggregations; Figure displays the environmental ground- truthing transects overlaid on shaded relief plot for the survey site. Camera stations were prioritised according to proximity to the proposed development locations, in the following order:  500 radius of the originally proposed Alternative location: three transects and one drop down location were positioned over potential corals and different habitat types with 500 radius of proposed well Alternative 1, This was to aid assessment of the corals that may be within the area of influence from drill muds and cuttings; the exact extent of which may be later determined using flow models. Other habitats of interest were also covered by the proposed camera locations.  500 radius of the originally proposed Alternative location: four transects were positioned within 500 of proposed well Alternative for the same purposes as above.  60 radius of each Alternative anchor location (Anchor to Anchor inclusive): potential coral structures and habitat changes were to be investigated using transects within 60 radius of each of the proposed anchor locations for Alternative 1. Where no features were identified in the side scan data for these zones, the closest corals / habitat types outside the 60 zones were selected for camera investigation. The purpose of these transects was to identify any potential coral structures that may be impacted by the installation of the anchors.  The remaining transects and drop-down station were positioned over features which were interpreted as being potential corals; different habitat types; and depressions with high reflectivity centres. These features were selected in order to represent other features of similar side scan signatures across the survey site, so that habitat classification could be extrapolated across the site where features had not been ground-truthed.

The survey location, station number and date were also displayed. See example video clips via hyperlinks in Table 2.2. 2.2 Seabed Photography Interpretation Methodology To characterise the seabed sediments and fauna within the survey site, detailed analysis of video and stills photography data was undertaken by experienced marine biologists / taxonomists. Each still photograph was classified according to the sediment type and any identifiable epifauna (surface-living animals) were recorded in detailed digital stills photograph log (Appendix B.2). Similarly, video data was reviewed, noting the locations of any observed changes in sediment type and / or associated faunal community (Appendix B.3). Particular attention was paid to any vulnerable environmental resources, as defined by Chapter of the Activities Regulations (Petroleum Safety Authority Website), and Norwegian Red List species. Details of relevant Norwegian Red List species are provided in Section 1.4. An in house classification system, modified from that proposed by Moen and Svenson (2004) has been used to more accurately describe the coral formations typically encountered in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. As such, reef structure is classified into five zones; Lophelia pertusa (gravel), Lophelia pertusa (dead), Lophelia pertusa (poor), Lophelia pertusa (moderate) and Lophelia pertusa (good). Areas of non-coral habitat are classified as either soft sediments or mixed sediments, while occurrences of corals other than Lophelia pertusa are classified as other corals. For the purpose of this survey colonies of other corals were numerically recorded along each camera transect (Appendix B.3; Figure to Figure 3.11). Table describes the eight classifications in greater detail and includes hyperlinks to example video clips. An example photograph of each classification is provided in Figure and Section 3.3.

Reference source not found. and shaded relief map focused on the environmental locations and proposed development is displayed in Error! Reference source not found.. Water depths are referenced to Mean Sea Level (MSL), predicted and generated from the Atlas of Tides on the Shelves of the Norwegian and the Barents Sea. MSL is above LAT at this area. Depths ranged from min the northeast to in the west-southwest. The seabed within 100 of the proposed Cooper well location generally deepened to the west- southwest exhibiting gradients of <2 at the proposed location. local maximum gradient of 9 was observed associated with an iceberg ploughmark. Water depths within this area varied from to MSL, range of m. The seabed across the site presented an underlying slope of approximately 1 with water depths varying between MSL in the northeast to MSL in the west-southwest, range of 16.3 m. Locally, the seabed was highly irregular and rugged due to the presence of numerous iceberg ploughmarks. The iceberg ploughmarks generally trended from northeast to southwest with depths of up to compared to the surrounding seabed. Cold water corals, with heights of up to m, were associated with the iceberg ploughmarks growing along the flanks. Maximum gradients of 40 were found locally where these existed however the multibeam echosounder at this depth was unable to pick up much detail with such complex coral outcrops. 3.2 Seabed Features (FSLTD/Report Number: 00604V1.2). seabed features chart is presented in Appendix A.3 of Volume 1, while areas of cold-water coral are shown within this volume in Figure and Figure 3.12. Seabed sediments across the survey site were interpreted to comprise thin intermittent veneer of very soft to soft slightly sandy, occasionally gravelly CLAY (<0.1 thick) with areas of very soft to stiff slightly gravelly clays. Coarser material (cobbles / small boulders) occurred at the margins of some iceberg ploughmarks. Very loose silty, slightly gravelly SAND partially infilled some of the iceberg ploughmarks. This was confirmed by photographic data acquired as part of the habitat investigation survey. Numerous cold water corals were identified across the survey site, with the majority of these to the south and west of the proposed location (see Appendix A.3 of Volume 1). There were typically 50 coral outcrops per square kilometre in the south-western part of the site. The coral generally exhibited heights of less than but locally exhibited heights of up to m. Specific height measurements are shown on the Seabed Features chart as different coloured dots.

All seabed video footage and digital stills photographs were reviewed in detail. Detailed logs of the data obtained are provided in Appendix C. Occurrences of the Norwegian Red List species Lophelia pertusa were classified into five categories (gravel, dead, poor, moderate and good) in accordance with Table 2.2. Occurrences of the soft coral species Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis were assigned to the other corals category, whilst the sediment type encountered across the survey site was separated into two types (soft sediments and mixed sediments). Sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.8 provide brief description of each habitat, the associated fauna and the general distributions across the survey site. Further information on the distribution of habitats is provided in Section and details of habitat distribution in relation to the proposed development are provided in Section 3.4.2. Information on the sediment type and fauna evident on each still photograph and on the seabed video footage was used to classify the habitat. For the purposes of this report the European Nature Information Service (EUNIS) coding system was used for the classification of biotopes. This is marine biotope classification system for European waters that has been developed by the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity and the European Environmental Information Observation Network and is based on hierarchical analysis of habitat. Initially marine habitats are defined at eight broad levels, biological communities are then linked to these (at three lower levels) to produce biotope classification. Table 3.1: The EUNIS Biotope Classification Hierarchy Level Hierarchy Description Example Classification Name Example Classification Code 1 Environment Marine habitats 2 Broad Habitat Type Deep-sea bed A6 3 Habitat complex Deep-sea bioherms A6.6 4 Biotope complex Communities of deep-sea corals A6.61 5 Biotope Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs A6.611 3.3.1 Soft Sediments The soft sediment habitat comprised fine silty, slightly gravelly sand with sandy clay in areas, as described in the seabed features (Section 3.2). Soft sediment was typically observed in areas between iceberg ploughmarks and in the central sections within the ploughmarks. The deeper, offshore sediment biotopes are not described to the same level of detail as their shallower, more accessible counterparts and are currently in development by EUNIS, as more data is acquired. This habitat and its associated faunal assemblage may be described by the EUNIS biotopes A5.27 Deep circalittoral sand and A6.4 Deep-sea muddy sand, which comprise offshore (deep) circalittoral habitats with fine sands or non-cohesive muddy sands and include diverse range of polychaetes, amphipods, bivalves and echinoderms (EUNIS, 2011). FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 19', 'Passage_id': 80}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/11-9 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The observed diversity throughout the soft sediments was not as high as the areas of mixed sediments or areas of coral substrate; faunal assemblages associated with soft sediments are known to be dominated by infauna, with reduced epifaunal component. The recorded epifauna comprised sea cucumbers (Parastichopus tremulus); various seastars (Asteroidea), particularly yellow seastars (Henricia sp.); the pencil sea urchin (Cidaris cidaris), sea urchins (Echinoidea); brittlestars (Ophiuroidea); various sponges (on occasional gravel and cobbles) including Phakellia sp. and the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas to lesser extent, also the stalked sponge (Stylocordyla borealis) was found on one occasion during Transect 4; green spoon worm (Bonellia viridis); squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); crabs (Decapoda); various fish, particularly the redfish (Sebastes sp.) and cod-like fish (Gadidae). Considerable numbers of Gadidae fish were often observed, many of which appeared to be feeding. Bioturbation, in the form of burrows, was recorded throughout the majority of soft sediment areas, indicating the presence of relatively large infauna, most likely shrimp (Caridea). An example photograph of the soft sediment habitat is provided in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Example Photograph of Soft Sediment (Trans_01) Krill 3.3.2 Mixed Sediments Laser points 15 cm apart Redfish, Sebastes sp. The mixed sediment habitat displayed similar characteristics to the soft sediment habitat, but encompassed coarser sediment fraction, consisting of patches of pebbles, cobbles and occasional glacial erratic boulders. The density of the coarse fraction was observed to vary across the habitat, showing wide spatial distribution and generally associated with the flanks of the iceberg ploughmarks. The distribution of coarse sediments in this region is commonly determined by glacial processes; ridges of lithic material were formed by the ploughing motion of icebergs through the seabed which were then infilled by fine sediment, whilst the scattered boulders are typically the result of glacial deposition. Identification of mixed sediment areas from side scan sonar data was reliable as FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 20', 'Passage_id': 81}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/11-9 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: CENTRICA ENERGY RIG SITE SURVEY PL477, NOCS 6506/11 COOPER the sonar signature was not distinctly more reflective than the soft sediments; note that the mixed sediment habitat composed of coarse material in association with soft sediment. Mixed sediment was highly interspersed with patches coral habitats, which require stable foundation of coarse substrate. Where transects crossed iceberg ploughmarks, soft sediment was usually observed in the trough of the ploughmark  between patches of mixed substrate. Mixed substrate was the most commonly encountered habitat, which reflects the targeted nature of the ground-truthing programme and does not necessarily reflect the true proportion of the habitat in the survey site. This habitat could only be tentatively matched to the EUNIS biotope A4.12 Sponge communities on deep circalittoral rock and also showed elements of the A6.62 Deep-sea sponge aggregations biotope. Mixed sediments were associated with an increase in faunal abundance due to an increase in substrate for epilithic attachment and refuge for motile species, though diversity did not increase greatly. The coarser sediment fractions within this habitat provided substrate suitable for colonisation by variety of encrusting and erect sponges (including Phakellia sp., Mycale lingua and the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas), which appeared to dominate the epifauna. The Red List gorgonian coral Paragorgia arborea, which typically associates with Lophelia structures, were twice observed in this habitat. Squat lobsters (Galatheidae); seastars (Henricia sp.); cushion stars; holothurian sea cucumbers (Parastichopus tremulus); pencil sea urchins (Cidaris cidaris); anemones (Actiniaria); squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); shrimp (Caridea); hermit crabs, (Paguroidea); green spoon worms (Bonellia viridis); polychaete tubeworms (Sabellidae); various fish, particularly the redfish (Sebastes sp.) and cod-like fish (Gadidae), and one sighting of the rabbitfish (Chimaeriformes) were also recorded. An example photograph of the mixed sediment habitat is provided in Figure 3.2.

Two species of gorgonian were encountered, the Norwegian Red List bubblegum coral, Paragorgia arborea (Figure 3.3); and the sea fan Primnoa resedaeformis. On average corals were recorded per 100 of all transect classifications, while 15.4 corals per 100 of transect over Lophelia classifications. As mentioned in Section 3.3.2 only two occurrences of gorgonians were recorded on substrate other than Lophelia coral; gorgonians require secure, solid surface to grow from and Lophelia structures provide suitable foundation. It is noteworthy that Paragorgia arborea, which grows readily on Lophelia structures, was occasionally observed growing in mixed sediment and Lophelia  gravel habitats, while Primnoa resedaeformis was only ever observed within Lophelia  dead to Lophelia  good habitats; it appears Primnoa requires the more substantial base of the coral mound from which to grow. The EUNIS biotope classification which best explains the habitat within which gorgonian corals occur is A6.611 Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs for the general environment in the Norwegian sea, and the reef communities, while the biotope A5.631 Circalittoral (Lophelia pertusa) reefs provides further detail on the association of gorgonians with Lophelia. The macrofauna associated with the gorgonians were also relevant to the Lophelia coral habitats; which is discussed further in Sections 3.3.4 to 3.3.8.

The Lophelia pertusa gravel habitat comprised fine silty sand sediment with mixed component of lithic (of rock origin) gravel and cobbles. This was overlain by coral debris in the form of L. pertusa gravel; with the density and coverage of the coral gravel varying across the habitat. From the data obtained, the distribution of the habitat generally appeared to be limited to the flanks of the iceberg ploughmarks, where the sediment type was typically seen to grade from the mixed sediment habitat to L. pertusa gravel, and was often in close proximity to Lophelia dead habitat. The Lophelia gravel habitat was often found to be in proximity of the higher quality Lophelia classifications, however it was also occasionally recorded in areas not considered to be obvious iceberg ploughmarks, and outside of delineated areas of coral interpreted from the geophysical data. The distribution of Lophelia gravel was predictable to some extent, as it generally coincided with areas of slightly lighter sonar reflectivity on the higher reflective flanks of iceberg ploughmarks, and often surrounded elevated coral mounds. However the sonar reflectivity of Lophelia gravel was very similar to that of mixed sediment and it was therefore not possible to distinguish between the sonar signatures of the two habitats when they occurred together. A similar epifauna was associated with the Lophelia gravel habitat to that of the mixed sediment habitat, with encrusting / colonial fauna dominating the species identified. Characterising fauna included various sponges (Porifera; specifically Phakellia sp, Mycale lingua, the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas); the green spoon worm (Bonellia viridis), squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); sea cucumber (Parastichopus tremulus); pencil sea urchins (Cidaris cidaris); anemones (Actiniaria); polychaete worms; various fish including redfish (Sebastes sp.); and infrequent colonies of the Norwegian Red List gorgonian, Paragorgia arborea.

The distribution of the habitat appeared to be linked to the distribution of the Lophelia pertusa gravel habitat, which typically appeared to grade into Lophelia reef where present; aggregations usually indicate either proximity to live coral reef or first stages of establishing a reef (Freiwald et al., 2004). As such the spatial distribution of the dead Lophelia habitat was generally limited to the flanks of ploughmarks, where exposed hard substrate was present. This habitat classification was encountered on 43 occasions throughout the survey. This habitat was best described by the EUNIS biotope A6.611 Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs, however little detail was provided as this biotope is still under development (EUNIS, 2011). The species present within the habitat was similar to that observed within the mixed sediment habitat and the Lophelia gravel habitat, comprising mainly encrusting and colonial species such as cold water coral specimens (Primnoa resedaeformis and Paragorgia arborea) and various sponges (Porifera; specifically Phakellia sp, Mycale lingua, the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas; among others). The encrusting fauna present, particularly the gorgonians, were notably larger and more numerous than those observed in the aforementioned mixed sediment and Lophelia gravel habitats. It is likely that the increased density of hard substrate for attachment and the greater stability of this hard substrate facilitated the growth of larger specimens of attached fauna. The gorgonian Primnoa resedaeformis was recorded only on the coral habitats of Lophelia  dead to Lophelia - good; this species appeared FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 24', 'Passage_id': 85}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/11-9 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: to be dependant on the reef structure as no photographic stills or video data showed this sea fan occurring in the soft sediment, mixed sediment or Lophelia  gravel habitats.

The Lophelia poor habitat was similar to that of the Lophelia dead habitat comprising largely dead L. pertusa reef structures, but differed in that small, sporadic colonies of living L. pertusa were present. Other characterising fauna included sponges (Porifera) and gorgonian colonies (P. arborea and P. resedaeformis); the epifaunal community recorded within this habitat was identical to that detailed in the Lophelia  dead habitat.

This habitat was generally associated with the more substantial coral structures. Again, other characterising fauna were sponges (Porifera) and the gorgonians P. arborea and P. resedaeformis. The moderate L. pertusa habitat was encountered on 21 occasions (see Figure 3.7). 3.3.8 Lophelia  Good Lophelia - good (i.e. apparently intact colonies or mounds of living L. pertusa approaching diameter) was recorded at 14 locations in the Cooper site. Again the epifaunal community was comparable to that observed with the other Lophelia habitats. The largest Paragorgia arborea colonies were found to be growing in association with this habitat (see Figure 3.8). Further information is provided in Section 3.4.

Distribution plots of the habitats have been created to display habitat classifications along transects for selected number of stations (see Figure to Figure 3.11). In addition an overview plot has been created displaying the occurrence of coral mounds across the Cooper survey site, interpreted from the geophysical data (Figure 3.12). Delineated patches of interpreted coral were found to occur in higher densities in the south-western half of the Cooper site (approximately 50 per km2), with considerably fewer patches in the region north-east of the proposed development (see Figure which shows general pattern of coral distribution). The abundance of coral patches was highly dependant on the spatial distribution of iceberg ploughmarks, the flanks of which typically comprise mixed / coarse sediment and provide suitable, elevated conditions for the growth of Lophelia structures. This area was unusual in that iceberg ploughmarks were located in the deeper section of the survey site and less so in the shallower area, whereas ploughmarks are usually absent in deeper waters where the seabed is below the reach of icebergs. The total distance of combined camera transects carried out in the survey site was just over km, of which 25% (1.6 km) was classified as Lophelia  gravel to Lophelia  good. Of the Lophelia habitats encountered, 70.7% were classified as gravel; 12.0% as dead; 8.2% poor; 5.5% moderate; and 3.5% as good. The delineated areas of coral interpreted from the geophysical data amounted to combined area of km2, of the total survey site of 52 km2. Therefore, by extrapolating the classification proportions for all delineated areas in the Cooper site, 3% was considered Lophelia habitat, ranging from gravel classification to good classification. Using the ground-truthed transects and the total areas of interpreted coral, the areas of each classification were calculated (see Table 3.2). Lophelia  good was predicted to cover 0.11% of the Cooper site, while Lophelia  gravel, the largest proportion, was expected to comprise 2.13% of the site. Note: the calculations used to extrapolate Lophelia classifications across all patches may have overestimated the areas, as the ground-truthing revealed the delineated coral patches to comprise some mixed sediment habitat; there were changes in sediment at fine scale within the interpreted facies that could not be completely resolved.

Documented sediments were highly heterogeneous; all eight habitat classifications were recorded and distribution was strongly influenced by the distribution of iceberg ploughmarks. Soft sediments were generally found within the troughs of the ploughmarks and between ploughmarks, while mixed sediment was limited to the berms of the ploughmarks and general elevated features. (see Figure to Figure 3.11). 3.4.2.1 Coral Aggregations within the 500 Zone of the Proposed Cooper Well Location One camera transect was performed within the 500 zone of the proposed Cooper well location, Alt1_Anch4_Trans. The sediments documented along this transect comprised predominantly mixed sediments of sand with gravel and some pebbles and boulders, although an area of Lophelia gravel was also evident. No live hard or soft corals were encountered along transect Alt1_Anch4_Trans. No coral colonies were interpreted to be present within 100 of the proposed Cooper well location. The closest potential coral feature was considered to lay 118 south-southeast. Coral was interpreted to be present at number of discrete locations within 500 radius of the proposed Cooper well. The majority of coral colonies were present along the edge of an iceberg plough mark running west-southwest to east-northeast, and passing south of the proposed well location. Additional coral colonies were interpreted to occur further away from the proposed well Cooper well location, toward the west and south-southwest edges of the 500 zone. 3.4.2.2 Other Seabed Features Numerous depressions were identified throughout the survey site, most of which exhibited high side scan sonar reflectivity centres. High reflectivity centres can sometimes indicate the presence of methane-derived authigenic carbonates (MDAC), which occur in sediments where hydrocarbons are actively released. Two depressions with high reflective centres were investigated during camera operations, one in the central region of the survey site (Alt1_Drop_01) and one to the south-east of the survey site, at Transect 07. The high reflectivity at both depressions was found to relate to the presence of coarse, mixed sediment; soft sediment with substantial component of gravel and cobbles. No MDAC or gas release was apparent in the photographic data, and side scan data revealed no facies of gas-bubble plumes in the water column. The depressions were therefore considered to be heel marks, caused by icebergs vertically spinning in one place while in contact with the seabed.

The patch test consisted of leaving the current motion sensor offset values in the EM710 SIS acquisition software, and running the standard set of patch test lines. The patch test site consisted of slope located approximately 35km off the East coast of the UK. The slope site was chosen due past hydrographic surveys conducted. The immediate seabed around the wreck was relatively flat making the site suitable to resolve all factors; position latency, pitch, roll and alignment. The calibration lines were planned using the Voyager5 PlanIT program, with the patch test data being acquired using the Kongsberg SIS acquisition software, and the calibration factor being determined in the SIS calibration module. verification was then undertaken with these new values entered into SIS, and processed using Caris HIPS and SIPS version 8.1.

This causes the pressure pulse called pretest drawdown. The combination off low rate and snorkel determines an effective range of operation. The maximum drawdown pressure pulse can be determined from the well- known spherical flow equation where dPdd is the final drawdown pressure differential at time t=oo.

Exact Mobility Analysis By analyzing the drawdown curve and the build-up curve it is possible to calculate the mobility of the formation. The mobility is defined as the permeability divided by the viscosity (md/cp). Therefore if the viscosity of the fluid being drawn is known, it is also possible to determine the formation permeability. The fluid being drawn into the pretest is normally assumed to be the mud filtrate so if the mud type is known it is possible to estimate the filtrate viscosity. The two methods of determining the mobility are shown by the two equations below. First is the drawdown mobility Mdd that uses the drawdown pressure differential (i.e.,dPdd=Pstop-Pdd_end) and is the most common method used in the industry. It is normally referred to as the steady-state spherical method. The second is the exact spherical mobility Mexact that typically uses the buildup curve. simplified form of the exact method is shown in Figure-1 which is an exponential with magnitude of (pressure, psi) and time constant of a(sec). Both the drawdown and buildup curves can be analyzed but normally the buildup is used. The curve fit parameters alpha and beta f are used to determine the mobility. Generally these Mdd and Mexact are very similar except in low mobility zones where the mobility is < md/cp. In this case the Exact method yields the most accurate estimate of Mobility. 14,696 q Z o Mdd=  __   Drawdown spherical mobility (md/cp) 2,r  OP dd   -A 14,696   Z tp o     1-  fi  rp   2f Exact spherical mobility (md/cp) dtpdraw down production time(tdd_end-tdd_start ,sec) a.........Exact curve fit time constant (sec) f...Exact curve fit build up constant (psi)', 'Passage_id': 99}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/12-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY Department of Reservoir Geology Reservoir Geophysics and Petrophysics Title PETROP1 YS CAL [VALUATION REPORT, WELLS 15/12-4, -5 AND -6 Requested by PUT LIS/S Project 15/12-Beta-West Date August 1991 No. of pages IS No. of enclosures Report no.

SUMMARY A petrophysical evaluation of the Oxfordian sands in wells 15/12-4, 15/12-5 and 15/12-6 has been done. The Oxfordian sands are divided into zones, and average values for net- gross, porosity, water saturation and permeability are calculated for each zone. Logs, core and formation multi-tester data are used in the evaluation. Test data are available in wells 15/12-5 and 6. Log data in 15/12-4 and are of good quality, while there are intervals with poor hole conditions in 15/12-6. In 15/12-6 the cored interval covers the whole Jurassic sand interval, while in 15/12-4 and 5, only the upper part of the sand has been cored. SCAL-data were available only in 15/12-5 at the time of the evaluation. Porosities are generally estimated from density logs which are calibrated to core data. Sand-curves are defined using cutoffs for porosity and shale volume, and by manually defining cemented layers within the sand.

Results from the petrophysical evaluation are shown in tables and CPI-log plots included in this document. 2. INTRODUCTION The petrophysical evaluation of wells 15/12-4,5 and is part of study to build the 15/12-Beta-West geological model. The results from the petrophysical evaluation will be used for volumetric calculations and as input data for reservoar simulation. The 15/12-Beta-West reservoar lies within good quality late Jurassic (Oxfordian) sandstone. high degree of faulting divides the stucture into at least three segments with different pressures. In parallel with the petrophysical evaluation, new seismic interpretation is done, and new geological model is built, in which the Oxfordian sandstones are divided into nine units. A previous petrophysical evaluation of the three wells has been performed following well completion, and separate reports of these evaluations exist. For 15/12-6 the calculated curves from the previous evaluation have been used unchanged. In addition, overburden corrections are made for the core data, and permeabilities are calculated as well. For 15/12-4 and -5 new evaluation is performed. However, FMT-pressure data and temperatures are taken from the previous\", 'Passage_id': 101}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/12-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: pressure regimes for the three wells. Reference is made to Petrophysical Evaluation Report for each of the three wells, as well as to fig. 1. 3.2.7 Temperature Temperatures have been estimated from extrapolation of log temperatures and from test data. See table for temperature values. 3.2.8 Overburden corrections Overburden correction factors are calculated from SCAL-data in 15/12-5. Calculation gives an effective reservoir pressure of 274 bar for this well. The overburden pressure is found by taking the integrated density less the fluid pressure from FMT-data. The calculated overburden correction factors are for porosity (fig. 2) and for permeability (fig. 3). These factors are assumed to be valid for all three wells. 3.2.9 Shale volume In 15/12-4 and -5 the shale volume is taken as the minimum of the shale volumes when calculated from the Gamma Ray and from the density/neutron crossplot. In 15/12-6 the shale volume is estimated from the Gamma Ray only.

In addition COAL has been picked manually as well. An interval is defined as net SAND when it is not defined as KALK or COAL, and if the following criteria are met: Shale volume, Vsh < 40% Porosity, PHIF > 12% In 15/12-6 the same cut-off values has been used, except that KALK has not been manually defined. 3.2.11 Porosity The porosity is calculated from the density log for wells 15/12-4 and -5. The relation PHIF = * RHOB + is used. The constants and are estimated from crossplots of overburden corrected core porosity versus log density (RHOB). The regression line is forced through the point (Rhoma,91),where Rhoma is the mean matrix density from core data for each well.

Normally it would be preferable to use the same saturation model for all three wells. However, because of the low shale content in the oil-zones and the high salinity of formation water, the two models will give only minor differences in the calculated saturation values. For 15/12-6 we therefore used the curves from the recent petrophysical evaluation following the well completion. The a, in and n-exponents are taken from SCAL-data in well For use in volumetrics plot of SW versus height above OWC is made. The Sw-curve is visually fitted to the calculated zonal average points.The relationship is assumed to be valid for the whole Beta-West area. (see fig. 27) 3.2.13 Permeability Horisontal permeability (KLOGH) is derived from the log porosity curve (PHIF) by the relation log KLOGH = * PHIF + where the constants and are estimated from crossplots of overburden corrected core permeability versus log porosity. For 15/12-4 and -5, where the sands are only partially cored, relations from corresponding zones in 15/12-6 are used. This represents high degree of uncertainty, but no other methods are found to be more appropriate. Table 3.2.13 lists the estimated and b-values for the various wells and zones of interest. Figs. through 21 show the crossplots. Aritmetic and geometric mean values for each zone are calculated for the porosity-derived permeability. The same is done for horisontal core permeability for the cored zones.

The KLV/KLH-factor is estimated to 0.835. The KLV/KLH-factor in the 15/12-6 well varies considerably between the upper and the lower sand intervals. The factor has value of in the interval 5 MDRKB, probably do to high degree of fracturing, while it is in the interval 9.

Figure illustrates maximum, minimum and most likely pressure curves for the different reservoir zones. Pore Pressure above reservoir level From seabed down to approximately 1450 TVD, hydrostatic pressure gradient is expected. The pore pressure build up from 1450 TVD RKB to top reservoir level is verified by RFT measurements in Lista / Sele Fm. in wells 34/7-17 and -18 south of the Snorre Field. shaded area illustrates uncertainty in pressure estimates throughout the Rogaland Op and the Shetland Fm as illustrated in Figure 5.8.  Reservoir Pore Pressure The pressure development in the WFB depends on several elements:  Production, injection and aquifer response  Sand volumes  Sand connectivity  Deposition / erosion  Faulting and fault seal  Crossflow in wells Lack of frequent PLT logs and poor allocation control between sands in the wells result in uncertain distribution of production and injection into different zones. The most important wells related to pressure in the P44 location are producer P-39 and the injector P-32. They are in the WFB-Main segment while P-44 will be drilled in WFB-North, introducing the uncertainty of fault sealing. Background for the pressure prognosis is given for each zone. Note that the pressures given are at datum of 2475 TVD MSL and must be corrected to the relevant depth of penetration using an oil gradient of bar/m. One of the most important factors for the pressure prognoses and the production behaviour of well P-44 are the degree of sealing in the faulted area between the southern parts of WFB-North and WFB-Main. The throw decrease from west to east, but the faulted area is still expected to give some restrictions and irregular communication. The FAWAG project of WFB will be ongoing in the northern part of WFB-Main (in well P-32) in the period prior to drilling P44 into the Statfiord Fm. It will be very important to keep the voidage of WFB-Main to maintain the reservoir pressure in WFB above 300 bar. Initial pore pressure at top reservoir level (2420 TVD MSL) is 379 bar, corresponding to an equivalent mud weight (EMW) of g/cc. At TD the initial pressure gradient has dropped to g/cc EMW (2534 TVD MSL). Cromer Knoll The Cromer Knoll Formation consists of marl and does not include any sands. Zone S5 It is uncertain if S5 will be present below Cromer Knoll in P44. If present, crevasse sands, probably sands with different pressures can be expected in 55. The sand continuity of S5 is low and it is', 'Passage_id': 106}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/7-P-44 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The low estimate is not equal to lowest Lower Statord pressure measured in WFB in well P-21 at 270 bar in the summer of 1998. Do not expect as low pressure as in P-21 because the faulted zone between P-44 and WFB-Main is likely to restrict the communication. Zones S2 and Si A review of the 34/7-4 well test interpretation has been done. The review concludes with no major changes of the conclusion; the test is not able to detect any restrictions. However the test is affected by tidal effects in distance of approximately 350 meters from the well (approximately at the same distance as the expected fault restrictions). High = 360 bar = Engineering judgement  expect at least some degree of communication between the sheet sands in Upper Statord and depleted reservoirs  estimated 20 bar from initial pressure. ML = 320 bar = Engineering judgement  expect somewhat higher pressure in Upper Statord in WFB-North compared to WFB-Main due to restrictions introduced by the faulted zone between P-44 and P-39. Low = 290 bar = Engineering judgement - based on general low level of Upper Statord pressure in WFB-Main. Assumes high degree of communication between WFB-North and WFB-Main. Important to note that this pressure could be highly affected by the possible low voidage (and pressure) due to the FAWAG project. Dunlin / TD The Mullin Op is in general shale and the well is not expected to penetrate any sands in Dunlin. 5.6 Wellbore Stability General Figure shows fracture and collapse curves (m MD RICB) in the reservoir based on most likely reservoir pressure. Figure 12 shows fracture and collapse curves throughout the well (m TVD RICB). The collapse curve (coil) identifies the mud weight necessary to avoid ovalization and fill; if loss situation is expected it is acceptable to run mud weight lower than the collapse curve. However, if mud weight is reduced below this criterion breakdown (collapse) could be caused. Two fracture curves are displayed, Sh(dP) and Fr(nonPen) - the first one represents the fracture gradient if the fluid communication between the wellbore and the formation is 100 %. It is identical to instantaneous shut-in pressure (ISIP) - the second fracture curve represents no communication between the well and the formation (100% effective mud cake); it is dependent on the well inclination and the angle between well azimuth and the direction of major horizontal stress. The two fracture gradients represent the two extremes. Both horizontal stresses and fracture gradients are dependent of the amount of depletion. A proper way to drill the reservoir will be to use comparatively low mud weight giving an ECD which is lower than or equal to the smallest fracture gradient Sh(dP) in the low pressure scenario, and then - if necessary - increase the mud weight moderately when the fracture strength has increased due to mud cake growth. 1 Snorre TLP Well Program Page of 21 FORMATION DATA', 'Passage_id': 107}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/8-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Page 11 2.

For daily maintenance of KCl-polymer fluid it is essential that the rig solids control equipment work at peak efficiency. However, it is expected that large quantities of whole-mud dilution will be necessary to maintain the fluids integrity and achieve desired mud specifications while drilling. The mixing of individual products direct to the active system should be avoided. Necessary adjustments to mud properties should be made first to the premix. Under no circumstances is seawater to be added to this system. 1. KC1 - The KC1 is to be maintained at concentration of approx. 45 lb/bbl for maximum inhibition of swelling clays. While drilling, the KC1 concentration will be adjusted as formation dictates.', 'Passage_id': 108}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/8-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Page 12 2. Rheology - The Y.P. (Yield point) should be maintained in the range of 10-15 pascal to achieve maximum hole cleaning. Milpolymer 302 is blend of Xanthan gum and guar gum and is used as the primary viscosifier in the system. The shear thinning characteristics of Milpolymer 302 results in minimum viscosities at high shear rates, but once the shear rate is reduced, the fluid regains viscosity and structure to enhance the hole cleaning capability. Dilution with drill water and/or whole mud will be necessary to control excessive rheological properties. No bentonite should be used in this system. 3. A.P.I. Fluid Loss - Troughout the section the A.P.I. fluid loss shall be maintained at level of 8-10 cc. Drispac Regular and Superb should be used to control the A.P.I. fluid loss at this level. These polyanionic synthetic products provide thin tough filter cake. It may however be difficult to obtain this low fluidloss initially when the fluid contains little or no barite or drillsolids. An initial fluidloss less than 10 cc is therfore not necessary. The initial amount of polymer added to the system shall be dictated by rheological properties and not by the initial fluid loss 4. Mud Weight - Adjustment to mud weight will be dictated by pore pressures and/or hole problems, and made only after consultation and approval of Norsk Hydro representative. 5. Encapsulation - Drispac have secondary function as protective colloid to reduce dispersion of sensitive shale formations. This function also enhances better solids removal to provide cleaner drilling fluid. 6. Solids Control - Screens for the primary shale shakers and mud cleaners should be of the smallest possible mesh that will tolerate the elevated flow rates anticipated in this section. Solids control equipment will be used to the maximum extent possible in order to minimize the build up of drill solids in the system.

Because neither method can be confirmed as best, the two results were averaged to obtain final shale volume. GRclean, GRshale, DPHISH, and NPHISH were defined from visual inspection of the sand and shale intervals. None were varied with depth or lithology. Porosity Total porosity was determined from the density log assuming RHOMA = g/cm3 and setting RHOFL to g/cm3 in the known oil leg and to g/cm3 in the water leg. This total porosity could not rigorously calibrated to core measurements, but appear reasonable when compared to field values. Effective porosity was calculated and stored, but not used in this analysis. Water Saturation Water saturation was calculated using the Archie relation employing the deep induction curve directly as RT and the total porosity determined from the density log. RW was assigned at ohmm, assuming 47 kppm chlorides and 160 degrees F. was set to 1.8 and was set to 2.0, both are standard values for moderate to high porosity sands. Reservoir Summation A volumetric assessment was undertaken for the Balder interval from 1733m to 1820m. To insure that thin beds get flagged, the shale volume cutoff in the base case was elevated from the customary to 0.5. However, to prevent too much shaly interval from passing the flag an RXO flag was also imposed in the oil leg (specifically rxo < ohmm was discarded as non-reservoir). porosity cutoff of 12% was employed to net reservoir sand, but no saturation flag was imposed in netting pay.

Our log interpretation report, dated November 25, 1969, included section on log quality as follows: Log Quality Log quality is fair to poor for the well logs run in the 25/10-1 well. Several discrepancies were observed on the induction electric log which are the result of the logging engineer's ineptitude. The SP curve shale base line was improperly located on Run so that the SP curve went off scale to the left at 4090 ft where the base of thick sand was logged. Apparently the logging engineer noted this, and shifted the SP curve to the right so that the log would appear on the film. comparison of the SP shale base line above and below the sand indicates shift of to 10 millivolts which should have been noted on the log. better technique would have been to relog with proper SP shale base line setting. There is also depth discrepancy of ft between Runs and which adds repeat section of 4 ft from 4500 to 4504 ft on the composite log. The BHC sonic log was very noisy and cycle skipping was especially severe on Run 4. Cycle skipping can be caused by faulty surface or downhole instrumentation, improper operational technique, or possibly by gas in the mud. We suggest that the sonic log be rerun in the event the well is reentered. Excessive borehole rugosity and enlargement prevented the effective use of the microlaterolog and compensated formation density log for forma- tion evaluation. Therefore, data from these logs was not relied upon for calculating resistivity indexes. The possibility that the SP base line shift between 3900 ft and 4090 ft was the result of formation change rather than an SP shift made by the logging engineer has been considered. If the shale beds above and below the thick sand from 3955 ft to 4090 ft have interstital waters which are much different in their chemical composition, then there is possibility that an SP change could occur. There is some evidence to support this possibility since the shale above the sand has an average induction log resietivity of ohm-m, whereas the shale below the sand has an average resistivity of ohm-m. resistivity gradient is present from the base of the sand to about 5400 ft. Also, transit time gradient is noted on the sonic log. These gradients suggest the possibility of an abnormal formation pressure condition in which case the change in shale resistivity could be accounted for by the degree of compaction of the shale beds. rather than by change in the chemical composition of the interstital water.\", 'Passage_id': 118}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/10-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: ft - - A review of the density log has been made and it is our opinion that it is properly scaled. Our original interpretation was made assuming standard bulk density scale of - - gm/cc. This assumption was made because the before and after calibration shows the mechanical zero to be at zero position on tract III. This is compatable for - - density scale. Since no mechanical zero shift was observed on the log at the pick up depth, we assumed that the scale had to be - - gm/cc rather than the 1.8 - - gm/cc scale shown on the log heading. Further study of the density log shows that the mechanical zero was shifted divisions or gm/cc to the right thus verifying the scale shown on the log heading. The mechanical zero shift of divisions was recorded at the conclusion of the log run and the mechanical zero is properly positioned at gm/cc. The density log readings reported on the log analysis report of November 25, 1969 are in error and should be corrected by gm/cc. This change in bulk density increases the calculated- porosity values causing them to be in reasonable agreement with porosity values calculated from the sonic log transit time. Since the density log measurements were not used in the calculations presented in our original memorandum on this well, no change is needed in the interpretations contained in the memorandum dated November 25, 1969.

This section was drilled with Oil Based Mud (OBM). The XPT run (Run 1) was performed to obtain formation pressure using Large-diameter probe (LDP). Formation pressures were evaluated from MD to MD. MDT run (Run 2) was performed to obtain formation pressure, acquire formation fluid samples and conduct Interval Pressure Transient Test (IPTT). The MDT tool string included an Extra-Large-Diameter (XLD) probe, Saturn 3D Radial probe (Saturn), and Dual Packer module (PA) . InSitu Fluid Analyzer (IFA) was used for fluid identification. Formation pressures were evaluated from MD to MD. total of eight samples were acquired during this run: two samples at each of tested depths (3647.7 MD (file no. 15), MD (file no. 10), MD (station file no. 14) and MD (file no. 13)). IPTT was attempted after pumping at MD (file no. 13). Permanent datum is mean sea level. All Wireline depth measurements were referenced to the drill floor which was located above mean sea level. Depths for all stations were correlated with Run ZAIT-MSIP-XPT-PEX-HNGS dated 13th of February 2020. Pretest Interpretation Summary Formation pressures were evaluated at 39 depths. At one depth in Run 2, pretests were performed both before and after pumping and drawdown mobility was also calculated based on main flowing period in addition to the pretest. Therefore total of 40 pressure tests are presented in this report. All pretests were processed and evaluated using InSitu Pro software. Only data from the quartz gauge was used for interpretation. Run Probe Quartz Gauge 1 LDP QCP 2 Saturn SRQP Test qualities and color codes were distributed as:  High  Medium  14 Low (8 Supercharged, Unstabilized)  21 Ungraded (20 Tight, No Seal) Gradient Interpretation Summary The following gradients were identified from the formation pressure measurements: A water gradient corresponding to density of g/cm3 can be calculated between MD (file no. 16) and 3827.5 MD (file no. 8). The gradient was calculated based on files no. and 6. As this gradient is concluded based on limited valid pressures, it is only indicative. A mud gradient corresponding to density of g/cm3 was calculated from the hydrostatic pressure readings after all pretests in Run 1. The mud report stated density of g/cm3. Sampling Station Summary Run 2_Station 15 (3647.7 MD): total volume of 37 was pumped from the formation at this depth using Saturn probe. The pumped fluid is predicted to be mixture of formation water and OBM filtrate, with possibly some small traces of gas (see sections 6.1.8, 6.1.10). Two MPSR bottles (SN: 3294 & 3409) were filled. Both bottles were opened in the same time in order to capture fluid pumped during up and down strokes. The time interval chosen for the fluid fraction display on the depth view plot is 227  228 min (during pumping). Maximum recorded drawdown pressure during pumping was approximately 284 bars. The drawdown before taking the samples was approximately 155 bars. Run 2_Station 10 (3782.0 MD): total volume of 61 was pumped from the formation at this depth using Saturn probe. The pumped fluid is predicted to be mixture of formation water and OBM filtrate, with some traces of gas (see sections 6.2.8, 6.2.10). Two MPSR bottles (SN: 3896 & 4409) were filled.

Objectives and Results The main objective of Well 30/9-B-38 was to improve drainage and accelerate oil production from Upper Ness (UN1 zone) and Lower Ness 3-5 (LN3-5 zone) in the western part of the Gamma South structure (Figure A-1). secondary objective was to evaluate the potential of the ORENL2 reservoir in the toe section. The objectives were achived. Operations Summary Reentry operations on Well 30/9-B-38 started on the 31st of January 2000. pack stock was set in the pre-installed 95/8 casing of B-38, and B-38 was kicked off by milling window in the casing in the interval 2 MD. The well was kicked off in the Shetland Group, and an 81/2 hole was drilled into the Ness Formation and landed according to the plan. Due to unexpected pressure build-up, the formation was exposed to an ECD of max sg, and return was lost as result of fractured formation. Several attempts to heal lost circulation were performed without success. TD for B-38 was set 5831 MD / 2678 TVD, and the hole was plugged back for subsequent sidetrack. B-38 AT2 was kicked off in the Shetland Group at 4674 MD / 2515 TVD on the 21st of February 2000. The 81/2 hole was drilled into the Heather Formation at 5293 MD / 2613 TVD, reached on the 25th of February. The string packed off and stalled out at several depths, and due to severe hole stability problems the hole was plugged back on the 2nd of March 2000 for subsequent sidetrack higher up in the well. The operations on B-38 started on the 14th of March 2000. The well was kicked off below the pre-installed 185/8 casing in B-38 at 1180 MD / 983 TVD. 171/2 hole was drilled to 3487 MD / 2135 TVD, and the 133/8 casing set at 3486 MD / 2134 TVD. The 121/4 hole was drilled to 5583 MD / 2662 TVD in the Upper Ness channel sand, and the 95/8 casing was run with the shoe at 5582 m MD / 2661 TVD. subhorizontal 81/2 section was drilled to TD for the well at 7082 MD / 2824 TVD in the Dunlin Group, reached on the 27th of April 2000. The liner was run to 6870 MD / 2755 TVD in the Lower Ness LN3-5 zone.', 'Passage_id': 121}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-B-38 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A-6 2 GEOPHYSICAL EVALUATION Well Results The depth and position of formation tops compared with prognosis for well B-38 A, B-38 AT2 and B-38 are listed in Table A-1 and Table A-2. Seismic profiles from the 3D amplitude cube and the acoustic impedance cube along the B-38 well track are given in Figures A-2 and A-3, respectively. The discrepancy between prognosed (adjusted to the drilled location) and actual depths of formation tops at reservoir level are more or less within the estimated uncertainty range, indicating that the seismic interpretation is fairly accurate in the area and that most of the discrepancy is caused by the velocity estimation in the depth conversion. The Base Brent in the toe end of the 30/9-B-38 at 7029 MD, was found 20 shallower than prognosed. This indicates that the interpretation needs some adjustment in this area. Above the reservoir, the drilled formation tops for 30/9-B-38 are consistently shallower than prognosed. This indicates that too low velocities have been used in the time-to-depth conversion for these horizons. At reservoir level, the seismic data quality along the first 2/3 of the horizontal section is considered to be fairly good, as indicated in Figure A-2. However, pronounced deterioration is observed towards the toe end, especially for the Base Brent reflector. This is probably related to degradation of reservoir sands in the Oseberg Formation towards south on the Gamma South Structure. Generally, in the Oseberg Field, low acoustic impedance values (green to blue colours on the seismic profile, Figure A-3) are indicative of sand. In the area of well Experience from drilling of 30/9-B-38 indicate high degree of correlation between low acoustic impedance intervals and sandy sequences.

Laboratory analysis indicates that the produced water probably is representative for the formation water in the well. more saline formation water would result in higher hydrocarbon saturation in the Cretaceous sands. The Rw used in this evaluation corresponds to salinity of 25000 ppm NaCl. To illustrate the sensitivity of Rw an alternative interpretation has been made by using formation water salinity of  ppm NaCl. The results are presented in figure 7.1. The light green colour shows the water saturation using formation water salinity of 25000 ppm NaC1 and the dark green colour represents  ppm NaCl. The decrease in water saturation is in the range of 3-5 % for the Cretaceous sands. The shale volume is also attended with uncertainties in this interpretation. shale volume analysis has been performed by calculating Vsh from Density-Neutron crossplot, Density-Sonic crossplot and the GR log. Due to sticking on the density-neutron tool the GR log from DLL/MSFL has been used to calculate the shale volume. sensitivity analysis has been performed by increasing the value of clean sand from the GR log with API. Figure presents the differences in net sand when the GR value for clean sand is increased. The Intra Lange II sand is most sensitive to the change in this value, and the increase of 5 API increases the net sand in this interval with almost meters. However, the results presented in table are believed to be most reliable. Even though the density- neutron logs are to some extent affected by sticking over the Intra Lange II sand, the trends from these logs should give good indication of the shale volume. An increase of 2 in net sand is probably too optimistic according to the RHOB/NPHI logs. The other Cretaceous sands are hardly affected at all by the change of this input parameter.', 'Passage_id': 137}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/7-B-8 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: S  Report Co.

The log tapes were read, decoded and loaded into the computer. Core data was entered by hand and merged with the raw log data. Zones where the logging tool was obviously sticking were replaced, where possible, by repeat sections. As mentioned previously, over some sections nothing could be done. Plots were made of the data on composite log in order to verify the computer file against the source logs. (There was in fact discrepancy on the deep laterolog for well 30/7-6 between 4013 and 4029m where the deep laterolog appears to fail. Close examination of the log print reveals splice in the film over this section, but we were unable to locate this repeat on the tape. For the analysis the induction log was used over this section.) For interest, the synthetic microlog response, derived from the MSFL, was played back for well 30/7-8, although this was not available on the print. For clarity of presentation, the NGT was played back separately, including the various ratios of the component curves. Environmental corrections were applied in accordance with the chart book, and the core data were depth matched to the logs. Crossplots of the matched and corrected data were produced to aid parameter selection, and these are shown in the Appendix. The crossplots include some derived values such as and values and: - apparent porosity, being (OCNL + OD)/2, uncorrected for clay or hydrocarbon effects; - apparent matrix density from the neutron density crossplot, again with uncorrected values; - apparent water resistivity, OA Rt;', 'Passage_id': 141}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/7-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: apparent volumetric photelectric absorption index Pe Umaa - 1 - OA but this was not really useable due to the heavy barite mud. From study of the raw log data and crossplots, it is clear that the interpretation problem is far from straightforward. Mica is present in both wells, but with much higher proportion in 30/7-8. Mica is heavy and radioactive and can easily be misinterpreted as being shale. This would lead to pessimistic evaluation of hydrocarbon-in-place. For well 30/7-8, NGT log is available. This is particularly useful where mica is present as the tool allows the distinction between mica (with high proportion of potassium-parented gamma rays) and clay (with higher proportion of thorium- parented gamma rays). If the thorium-potassium ratio is between and 3.5, this is most likely due to mica, whereas most clays have ratio above This effect is illustrated in figures and 3, showing thorium-potassium crossplots for the Tarbert and the Ness. The mica trend can clearly be seen in the Tarbert, but some clay is still present, whereas the Ness contains little or no mica. Comparison of the thorium-potassium ratio curve with the core descriptions shows good correlation between low ratio and presence of mica. There is also good correlation in this well between the presence of mica and the caliper showing oven gauge hole. This is consistent with the physical properties of mica, whose fine plate-like structure both blocks permeability and the formation of mudcake, and encourages the formation to flake away under abrasion. The presence of mica is, therefore, well established and the problem is selection of an interpretation method which is applicable to both wells. Any method which relies heavily on the NGT for example could not be used for 30/7-6. The standard approach would be to estimate the mica content from the vs GR plot and to use dual mineral method (for quartz and mica) for porosity. As may INTEBCOMP', 'Passage_id': 142}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/7-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: be seen in the Appendix, the vs GR plot does not offer very much resolution, and dual mineral porosity method does not allow for the presence of any other material such as feldspar or pyrite. The method adopted was to use INTERCOMP's ROCKS program to determine the mica content. The program uses the neutron, density and sonic logs to calculate the volumes of sand, shale, mica and porosity by least squares best fit technique. (In effect, the program solves four simultaneous equations - being the three log response equations plus the assumption that the four components add up to unity. Where an exact solution is not found, the solution giving the minimum error is used.) This method does not allow for hydrocarbon effects and assigns equal weight to each of the input logs and, therefore, is not considered precise enough to use the derived porosity values directly. (An error of, say, 10% on porosity value is clearly unacceptable, but an error of 10% on the mica fraction introduces an error of only pu on porosity.) The mica fraction, therefore, was calculated using the three porosity logs. This figure was then used to correct the response of the neutron and density logs to obtain the response for an equivalent mica-free formation. p brne = - Vmica mica ON = ON - Vmica ONmica mc These corrected responses were then entered into the neutron density crossplot, and porosity was calculated after correcting for shale and hydrocarbon effects as in the usual complex lithology method. This porosity is, of course, the porosity of the mica-free portion of the formation, and is, multiplied by (1 - Vmica) to get the corrected effective porosity. Shale Volume, Vsh, was taken from the minimum shale volume as indicated by the gamma ray, neutron, resistivity, neutron-density and density-sonic crossplots. In zones of bad hole, the program disallows the crossplot indicators. For well 30/7-8, the thorium curve of the NGT was used as the gamma ray.

The results are discussed below. With 11% cut-off on porosity ( = mD) and 70% cut-off in water saturation, this zone shows net pay with average porosity of 16.76% and average water saturation of 36.92%. The net sand interval (5% cut-off on porosity, no Sw cut-off) is with an average of 16.21% porosity. The interval is made up of alternating clean and micaceous sandstones, separated by thin shales or coals. The clean sands show high porosities, low water saturation and excellent permeability. The micaceous sands show slightly lower porosities, but with much higher water saturations and drastically reduced permeabilities. This is consistent with the relatively high surface area of mica flakes holding higher proportion of bound water, and also reducing the permeability. So although the water saturations are higher (40-50%) in the micaceous sands (4079-97 and 4107-27 mBRT), this is almost certainly irreducible water saturation and these sands should be included in any estimation of hydrocarbon-in-place. A gas-water contact is seen at mBRT. At the base of the Tarbert, below 4147 m, the water saturation appears to decrease. This is quite genuine reflection of the log data as may be seen by inspection. All the resistivity tools show an increase towards the base of this sand. This may represent tar mat, possibly coinciding with relict gas water contact. This well shows even better reservoir development than 30/7-8. With 11% cut- off on porosity and 70% on water saturation, the zone shows net pay with an average porosity of 21.2% and water saturation of 14.6%.

As expected, the results show an extremely high sweep efficiency of the Etive sands with dry gas breakthrough from the Etive sands to the Rannoch sands in the vicinity of the production wells (figure 11). Although the oil recovery after years (24%) was similar to Case 2(23%), some production acceleration benefits were observed due to the location of the injection well between the production wells, i.e. pattern-type displacement. This strategy resulted in delayed breakthrough of dry gas, and thus, the maintenance of higher productivities. Extension of this simulation case showed an oil recovery of 32% after 4.5 years. Case - Rannoch-Broom Injection/Rannoch-Broom Production The results of Cases and suggest that oil recovery from the Rannoch and Broom Sands represents limiting factor with respect to maximising recovery from the Rannoch and Broom sands prior to breakthrough of dry gas from the Etive sands. Thus, case was conducted with the same well locations as Case but completions only in the Rannoch and Broom sands. The results of this case showed a similar total oil recovery (33%) after years, but the recovery of oil from the Broom and Rannoch sands was much improved due to the increased sweep efficiency in these sands and the delayed breakthrough of dry gas from the Etive sands. Similar to Case 2, the dry injection gas moved predominantly upward into the Etive sands, sweeping these sands, and breaking through back into the lower sand in the region of the production wells, as shown in figure 12. Discussion and Comparison of Results Oil production rate versus cumulative production profiles for each of the four cases are shown in figure 13. Profiles of the mole percent methane in the produced gas are also presented for each case in this figure. The results presented in this figure show significant incentive for dry gas cycling over primary depletion. These results also show that, for the given reservoir description, production and injection in the lower quality Rannoch and Broom sands only (at least initially) represents the optimum recovery mechanism. The nature and quality of these sands will be the limiting factor in maximising oil recovery. Obviously, a recovery mechanism consisting of production and injection only in these lower sands requires that the productivity and injectivity of these sands be sufficient to maintain economic rates. The quality of these sands must also be sufficient to prevent substantial build-up of liquid saturation in the near wellbore region (i.e. large pressure gradients) which can severely impair well productivity. This recovery strategy would also be much less attractive if the Rannoch and Broom sands contained large permeability variations such as thin intervals with permeabilities approaching those in the Etive sands. An important result of the simulation cases is that the apparent optimum recovery mechanism is one which may not have been expected: i.e. produce and inject in the lower quality Rannoch and Broom sands only and leave, at least initially, the high quality Etive sands. This would also be feasible for the case of complete vertical flow barrier between the Etive and Rannoch sands. The wells could be recompleted when necessary to cycle in the Etive sands. Dual completions intially would allow monitoring of the Etive sands, while producing and injecting in the lower sands, to determine the level of communication across the low permeability interval. The results of these simulation cases indicate that the performance of gas condensate reservoir may be much more difficult to predict for given reservoir description than the performance of conventional black oil reservoir under water drive. Since the reservoir description will not be known with high level of accuracy when the decision is made to develop gas condensate reservoir, simulation will play an important role in determining the feasibility for range of possibilities. This study also emphasizes the critical role played by the reservoir geological model and, in order to make the model as realistic as possible, it is vital that maximum amount of data on permeabilities and permeability variation be collected by coring the initial appraising wells on gas', 'Passage_id': 146}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7018/5-U-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: - - U 1ISINTEF-GRUPPEN APPENDIX I: TABLE OF CONTENTS Artificial maturation of three claystone samples from Core 7018/05-U-01 and Core 7018/05-U-02 using hydrous pyrolysis TABLES Table A.I.1: Table A.I.2: Table A.I.3a: Table A.I.3b: Table A.I.3c: Table A.I.3d: Table A.I.4: Table A.I.5: Table A.I.6: Table A.I.7: Table A.I.8: Table A.I.9: Table A.I.10: Table A.I.11: Table A.I.12: FIGURES Figure A.I.1: Figure A.I.2: Figure A.I.3: Figure A.I.4: Figure A.I.5: Figure A.I.6: Figure A.I.7: Figure A.I.8: Total organic carbon content and Rock-Eval pyrolysis data.

Scanning electron microscopy of both thin sections and fracture surfaces has been undertaken in addition to conventional optical micros- copy. The samples of sandstones from Units and are quite similar with respect to texture, detrital grains and diagenesis. The samples are grain supported, fine to coarse grained sandstones with moderate to high porosity (Table 3.7.2). The grains are poorly to moderately sorted. The grain contacts are usually short and tangential. Clay and carbonate occur both as matrix and authigenic intergrain material. Quartz is the most abundant mineral in the examined samples and it occurs both as monocrystalline and polycrystalline grains. The monocrystalline grains are usually bright and relatively clear. Small inclusions of zircon, mica and apatite and very small (<1 pm), usually two phase, fluid inclusions are present in some grains. thin partly developed rim of authigenic, syntaxial quartz is observed on some grains (Figure 3.7.4). Quantification of quartz cement. is not undertaken, but it does not seem to con- tribute with more than 1-2 % by volume of any sample. The scarcity of euhedrally developed quartz may be due either to etching of prev,iously well developed crystal faces, inhibited growth due to the presence of other cements or matrix, or that the grains are eroded from previously quartz cemented formation and that the cement is abraded during transport. Inhibited growth is the most likely reason, since both etching and abradation should have affected all authigenic crystal faces in similar way. More than one generation of syntaxial quartz cement has not been distinguished. The polycrystalline fragments are both monomineralic and polymineralic. The former occurs as chert sourced from sedimentary formations or as very fine grained, aphanitic rock fragments with interlobate grain boundaries and no preferred crystal orientation, probably sourced from crystalline basement. The polymineralic grains consisting of quartz and feldspar/mica are often partly dissolved or partly altered. Feldspars are present both as albite and potassium feldspar. The potassium feldspars are both micro- cline pertites and grains without intergrowths. Under parallel nicols most of the feldspars present usual- ly have an impure, brownish appearance due to abundant minute inclusions. The inclusions are probably both primary iron oxides and secondary alteration products like sericite. Dissolution and diagenetic alteration have had significant effect on the feldspars (Figure 3.7.5). There are, however, differences within each feldspar group. Both albite and potassium feldspars, occur unaltered together with altered grains of the same groups, probably due to differences in origin. This indicates either different source areas for altered and unaltered grains or that they formed under differ- ent P-T-conditions in the same rock complex. Polycrystalline feldspar grains are usually aphanitic.

Petrographically, these are quartz arenites with low content of authigenic clay minerals (Figure 3.7.8). Petrographically and diagenetically, these samples are similar to Unit of 7230/05-U-02. more thorough description is given under that core (Chapter 3.8). The original composition and the diagenesis have lead to differences in the reservoir quality of the three units. In exception of carbonate cementation as present in Unit A, all units show different degrees of diagenetic reactions which can be explained by the detrital components present and may thus represent closed system reactions. These reactions are: -leaching and dissolution of detrital components as micas, feldspars and matrix, -precipitation of quartz, feldspar and clay minerals -and precipitation of minor components as pyrite, siderite and anatase due to very local chemical variations. Unit contains abundant feldspar and some mica and matrix, and it has the highest content of kaolinite and illite of the three units. Although diagenetic reactions have produced pore filling clay minerals, porosity and permeability are still high in Unit (Table 3.7.2) and none of the units should be excluded from having potential as reservoir rock on the basis of diagenesis only (see Reservoir evalua- tion below).

Units A and seem mineralogically very similar (Figure 3.7.9, Table 3.7.3). The feldspar mineralogy is observed to change with depth over the interval covered by these two units. In the two uppermost samples, potassium feldspar dominates while albite is the major feldspar in the remaining samples. This trend may indicate change of source area except at and where sanidine, which is common in volcanic rocks, occurs as the only feldspar. The clay minerals in Units and are mainly kaolinite with minor amounts of illite and chlorite. Mixed layered illite-smectite and chlorite mixed layers occur in some samples. Considerable amounts of siderite cement is present in few samples only. Only one sample of siltstone/very fine grained sandstone is analysed from Unit C.

However, soils, roots and coal shales show continental influenced environment in Unit A. very marginal marine depositional envi- ronment as tidal flat or lagoons is therefore likely for the unit. The fining upward sandstones capped by soils may represent fining upward tidal flats and/or tidal channel fill deposits overlain by salt marsh or coastal plain type of deposits. Soil developments and rooting may have taken place in areas aerially ex- posed in association with coastal plain environments. In Unit stacked fining upward intervals with conglomerate lags at the base and laminae of plant de- bris predominate. The association of rapid deposition (massive sandstones, common loading structures), marine palynomorphs and channel filling coarse grained sandstones indicates braided river deltaic de- positional environment. The coarsening upward interval may represent progradational shoreface type of environment in wave dominated parts of the delta system. gross picture of the unit shows more sandstone dominated lower (101.9 -80m) and upper (56 -34.2m) part with more fine grained deposits between. The fine grained part was possibly deposited distally from the active delta or at deeper water than the mouth bar/channel fill sandstones dominating in the upper and lower part. In Unit palynomorphs show nwine depositional environment. The seismic data indicates three unconformities within the cored interval. The lower unconformity may be the boundary between the sandy siltstone and the overlying sandstone at 115 m. There are no direct sedimentological or paleonto- logical evidences for this boundary, but this may be explained in lack of data, because only 50 cm of core was obtained below this boundary. The other two seismic unconformities coincide with the boundaries between Units A, and (101.9 and respectively). The unit boundary at m is an unconformity indicated by both sedimentology, paleontology and seismic data, and dramatic change from low energy marginal marine deposition in Unit to braided river deltaic environments in Unit took place at this boundary. The seismic data shows that Unit accumulated in possible paleovalley. The internal reflections show common channels cutting down into the underlying rocks, thus supporting the sedimentological interpretation. Palynological dating shows that Unit is of Norian age, while Unit is of (Norian)/Rhaetian age. The cycle chart presented by Haq et al. (1986) indicates major sequence boundary at the Norian-Rhaetian boundary. It is likely that the paleovally formed during the lowstand and that the deltaic complex was deposited during the following transgression in Norian time. Sedimentological, paleontological and seis- mic interpretation indicate an unconformity between Unit ((Norian)/Rhaetian) and Unit (Hettangian and Sinemurian). This unconformity may be correlated to sequence boundary in the uppermost Rhaetian time as presented by Haq et al. (1986).

The core is subdivided into Units A, and with the boundaries at and respectively. The unit boundaries correspond to seismic sequence boundaries. The Sinemurian to Middle-Late Toarcian Unit consists of fining upward mouth bar/distributary channel sandstones in bioturbated sandy bayfill and/or rooted sandy delta plain deposits. High porosity (about 30 %) and high permeability show that the rocks in this unit have reservoir potential. Thermally immature organic material of terrestrial origin occurs in fair to poor concentrations, but may be locally enriched in form of roots or clayey-silty laminae. brownish phos- phorite conglomerate occurs at the base of Unit which consists of fining upward bioturbated glauco- nitic sandstones to clayey siltstones deposited during transgressions in Aalenian-Bajocian through Late Bathonian-Early Callovian times. The unit contains poor concentrations of thermally immature and hydrogen-poor organic material. Minor hydrocarbon, staining was found in the middle of the unit, which is probably derived from an early mature source. glauconitic pebble conglomerate starts the Late Oxfordian through Late Kimmeridgian fossiliferous black anoxic shales of Unit C. probable in- conformity at 33 separates Early and Late Kimmeridgian black shales. From seismic data the shale seems to continue about 50 above the core, which means that the total shale thickness here is about 70 m. The black shales are excellently rich in thermally immature organic matter, which is of mixed marine-terrestrial origin and was deposited in an anoxic environment. Artificial maturation by hydrous pyrolysis suggests that this material may be oil-prone. 3.8.2 Seismic interpretation This core penetrates rn below seabed and is the longest core recovered in the Nordkapp Basin. The core has been subdivided into three lithological units, which all correspond to seismostratigraphic units (Figure 3.8.2 and Table 3.8.1). The lower unit is characterized by hummocky to chaotic seismic signature of variable amplitude. The lower part of this unit was penetrated by core 7230/05-U-03. The upper boundary of Unit is truncational and coincides with hiatus at 82 m. The seismic resolution does not permit characterization of the internal seismic signature of the middle unit, however, the boundary characteristics are interpretable. The base of the unit is an onlapping boundary while the upper junction is truncational.

Poor visibil- ity due to clay coating above 61 m, makes it difficult to give any detailed description of the type and de- gree of bioturbation. Different types of Plano!ties and Helmintopsis horizontalis are the most common trace fossils, but Teichicnus rectus, Diplocraterion habichi as well as biogenic sediment feeding structures also occur. Above 61 the only recognizable trace fossil is Heintintopsis horizontalis. Shell fragments, cephalopod hooks, belemnite fragments and fish remains also occur in the unit. Unit starts with dark grey shale with glauconite pebble laminae (up to cm in diameter) in the lower metre. The unit is separated in two parts with cm thick greyish clay flake conglomerate at 33 m. The lower part consists of black, fossiliferous shale. Pyritic and calcareous (shell fragments) lami- nae occur below 40 m. Siltstone laminae occur, paricularly in the uppermost meter, giving it coarsen- ing upward grain size trend. Cone-in-cone calcite concretions are common in the black shales. Buchia as well as ammonites are the dominant fossils in this part, while cephalopod hooks and other cephaloped fragments, fish remains and belemnite fragments also have been found. The upper part consists of more massive, black claystone with lnoceramus fragments as well as one ammonite frag- ment. This part is far less fossil rich than the underlyin unit. Diagenesis  41/ The diagenesis of this core is immature with low degree of compaction. The major chemical alterations are partly dissolution of feldspars, leaching of mica, matrix and feldspars, and precipitation of quartz, feldspar and kaolinite cements. Fourty-four thin sections from Units and have been examined by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition fracture surfaces have been examined under the SEM. Unit consists of medium grained to very fine grained sandstone (Figure 3.8.4). The grains are usual- ly well to moderately sorted, angular to subrounded, with tangential grain contacts. Pressure solution on quartz grain contacts is rarely observed. The detrital mineralogy of Unit varies with the grain size. In the thicker and coarsest grained beds, quartz is dominating with minor amounts of feldspar and mica. Feldspars, mica, matrix and fragments of organic matter (opaque to brownish orange under the optical microscope) are more common in the thinly laminated beds with rootlets. As an effect of the mineralogical differences, authigenic clay minerals are more abundant in the silty layers. Compaction seems to have had minor effects in the coarser part of this unit and except for some fracturing of mica, neither breakage of grains nor re-orientations are well demonstrated. Several mineral phases have formed during chemical diagenesis. The major phases are illite/kaolinite, quartz and potassium feldspar while pyrite, anatase and carbonates are minor and very locally developed. Sphalerite is found in one sample.

It is present as aggregates of kaolinite booklets (Figure 3.8.5), in association with remnants of Mite and/or muscovite and as layers in expanded mica grains (Figure 3.8.6). The illite has formed along cleavage planes of the mica (Figure 3.8.6), especially at the fringy, expanded terminations of the tabular grains. Quartz cement is not abundant, but is occassionally euhedrally developed where present. The quartz has formed syndiagenetically with kaolinite and precipitation may have commenced for while after forma- tion of kaolinite as it partly encloses kaolinite crystals (Figure 3.8.7). Dissolution and crystallization of syntaxial potassium feldspars also seem to have occurred syn- diagenetically with quartz and kaolinite precipitation (Figure 3.8.7). The feldspar crystallization starts at several nucleation sites on the detrital feldspars and develops into rod-like crystals (Figures 3.8.8) which finally developes into syntaxial cement-with.v111developed crystal faces. Dissolution and precipitation of potassium feldspar within the same sample and at the same time is due to the unstability of some of the detrital grains. These, are formed under chemical and physical conditions totally different from the sedimentary and diagenetic environment and are thus unstable. The cement, on the other hand, is low temperature/low pressure potassium feldspar. Albite is present in Unit both as monomineralic grains and in microcline pertites. Partly dissolved grains and seemingly unaltered grains may occur side by side. Syntaxial albite cement is not observed. The source of kaolinite, quartz and potassium feldspar is found in the unit itself (Table 3.8.2) as all necessary components are present. Formation of kaolinite by leaching of mica/illite and from dissolu- tion of feldspars will give excess silica and potassium which in turn are consumed during formation of quartz and feldspar. Pressure solution of quartz is observed, but is too scarce to be major local source of silica cement. Co-precipitation of kaolinite, potassium feldspar and quartz is earlier demonstrated by Bjorlykke et al. (1979) from pore water corresponding to the intersection between the stability fields of kaolinite, feld- spar and quartz in the equilibrium diagram of log K+/H+ versus log H4SiO4 (Garrels and Christ 1965). By increasing H4SiO4. relative to the sea water composition, quartz saturation will be reached as will also the equilibrium line between potassium feldspar and kaolinite, thus permitting the co- precipitation of these phases. There is marked change in petrography when we cross the boundary between Units and at 82.0 (Figure 3.8.9). The He-porosity is still high, about 25 %, but the permeability is lower than in Unit A. The reason for this is the generally higher content of matrix and glaucony present in Unit B.

Of two samples in Unit the uppermost one contained abundant kaolinite, illite, illite-smectite and some chlorite while mixed layers only occur as traces in the lowermost sample. The overall intensity of the lowermost sample is low, probably due to the presence of amorphous material (organic?). This may partly be responsible for the differences observed in the two samples.

Depth Smec Mix Mica Chi Kaol Qtz KFsp Plag Calc Dolo Sidr Pyr Cris 124.94 63.0_ Porosity and permeability The porosity and permeability values fall in two groups (Table 3.8.5). Highest porosity (range 29 - 37 %) and permeability (horizontal mD, vertical mD) occur in the well sorted sandstones in Unit A. Lower and variable porosity (14 - 35 %) and permeability (horizontal - 2400 mD, vertical - 1490 mD) occur in silty/clayey sandstones. The permeability of sandstones from Unit is generally low. Reservoir potential evaluation Sandstone samples from Unit have high to moderate porosity while the permeability values vary from poor to very high. The highest values are found in the well to moderately sorted sandstone beds which are considered as good quality reservoir rocks. These beds are, however, less frequent towards the top of the unit, where silty and clayey sandstone layers of poorer reservoir quality dominate. The latter still have high porosity, but the permeability, both vertical and horizontal, is usually low. The silty/clayey sandstones also contain impermeable silty claystone beds which may restrict the vertical permeability significantly, dependant of the horizontal extension of these beds. Well sorted sandstones of distributary channels and/or mouth bars cut the clayey/silty sandstones of the upper part of Unit A, and these well sorted bodies may cut down into each other and thus increase the reservoir quality of the upper part of the unit. Of factors that may reduce the reservoir quality of Unit we mention that poor lithification may cause sandstone production and mobility of clays during hydrocarbon production.

In Unit root structures (123.5 m, 119 m. - 96 and 90 in) show that these intervals have been rooted with land plants. Marine fossils (below m, at the level and above m) as well as trace fossils only known from marine environments as Diplocraterion parallelum (117 in, 111.5 m), Ophiomorpha (115 m), Thallassinoides (above m) and sediment feeding structures with spreiten (115 m, 102 m) indicate marine depositional environments for these intervals. Less diverse and dense bioturbation dominated by different Planolites commonly occur in association with root structures. They may have formed in terrestrial or brackish water environments. Also fresh water algae indicate strong freshwater influx. The fining upward cycles with trough and ripple cross laminations as the dominant structures in the clean sandstones point toward channel fill type of deposit. These channel fill deposits are associated with both continental and marine deposits and suggest that they may be distributary channels/mouth bar complexes in a ,d,eltaic environment. The marine bioturbated deposits may be shallow sandy bay fill deposits in the delta complex. The rooted and less bioturbated intervals may be the delta plain deposits. Cut-and-fill sandstones as well as thinner fining upward sandstones may represent crevasse splay channel fill deposits. These channels may also enter shallow bays. The lack of coal beds in the deltaic complex may indicate deposition on the outer part of delta plain to the delta front. Above the roots at 90 in there is an increase in both diversity and density of marine bioturbation as well as marine palynomorphs, probably caused by the sea slowly flooding the underlying delta plain deposits. Unit starts with phosphorite hardground with phosphorite pebbles with omission-suite Thallassinoides traces, probably representing condensed bed. It is abruptly overlain by fining upward totally bioturbated glauconitic sandstones to clayey siltstones. Coarsely agglutinated foraminifera indicate a marginal marine environment, and the trace fossils, e.g. Teichichnus rectus, indicate that the lower part (below ea 74 m) probably is lower shoreface deposit. T. recurs and Diplocraterion habichi occur down to about 63 and indicate slow deposition in shallow shelf. Above this level the only identified trace fossil Helmitztopsis horizontalis probably represents deeper shelf deposits. Graded sandstone lami- nae indicate some storm influence. Unit contains abundant glauconite and shows fining upward grain size trend. These together with the trace fossil stratigraphy suggest slow, transgressive deposition. calcite cemented bed (76 m), py- rite nodule/bed (63 m) and glaueonite beds (57-55.5 m) may represent condensation within the overall transgression.

In Spitsbergen the remanie deposits of the Brentskardhaugen Bed was formed by condensation of Toarcian, Aalenian and Bajocian deposits (Backstrom & Nagy, 1985). The assemblages from the Brentskardhaugen Bed at De Geerdalen examined by Below (1987) represent the polare to rosenkramzi ammonite Zones, which according to Wierzbowski et al. (1981) can be regarded as equivalent to the H. bifrons Zone to the D. levesquei Zone (i.e. Middle-Upper Toarcian) in NW Europe.

Perinopollenbes elatoides and Classopollis spp. The presence of Callialasporites spp. together with common Cerebropollenites thiergartii indicate Late to Middle Toarcian age, thus supporting the conclusions based on dinoflagellates.

The presence of C. dictydia may suggest that this assemblage is no older than Late Bathonian, assuming comparable range for this species in NW Europe and the Barents Sea Region. The assemblage recorded at is comparable to that described from the Pelion Member (Vardekloft Formation) in East Greenland (Fensome 1979).

Eg -INTEF-GRUPPEN In conclusion, the sandy-silty Units and contain poor to fair concentrations of terrestrially-derived organic material which is hydrogen-poor and has no significant potential for the generation of liquid hydrocarbons. The black shales of Unit show an excellent organic richness and contain organic matter of mixed marine-terrestrial origin which was deposited in strongly anoxic environment. The results of artificial maturation of black shale sample suggest that this material may be oil-prone. The cored section is thermally immature and has an approximate vitrinite reflectance of %Ro. Small amounts of migrated hydrocarbons have been found in sandstone at m. The geochemical parameters suggest that this oil may originate from source of late diagenetic to early oil window matu- rity. The organic geochemical data figures and tables are presented in separate volume of the report. Only summary figures will be presented in this section. A sample of the organic rich black shales from Unit was artificially matured using hydrous pyrolysis. - The results of this maturation experiment are described and discussed in the appendix volume. Thirty-six canned core samples were taken at ca. intervals and analysed for the composition of C1-C7 hydrocarbon composition of the headspace and occluded gas fractions (Figure 3.8.19). The con- centration of C1-C4 hydrocarbons is closely related with the organic richness of the rocks. The sandstones and siltstones at depths greater than ca. 75 m, i.e. Unit and the basal part of Unit B, are characterised by trace concentrations of hydrocarbons in the headspace gas (10-90 pl HC/kg dry rock) and moderate yields of occluded hydrocarbons (500-1400 ,u1/kg). The wetness of less than 20 % reflects the low concentrations of C2-C4 hydrocarbons. C5+ hydrocarbons are present at concentrations of less than 100 p1/kg. Between 75 and 52 m, the concentration of headspace hydrocarbons increases continuously to about 104 p1/kg. This gas is dominated by methane and shows wetness of less than 10 %. The concentra- tion of the occluded gas stays at approximately the same level as in Unit A, but the proportion of and C5+ hydrocarbons in this fraction is increased relative to the underlying section. Wetness values between 22 and 56 % were recorded in the interval between 55 and 61 m. At the base of the black shales (Unit C) the concentration of the C1-C4 hydrocarbons of both gas fractions increases abruptly by almost two orders of magnitude to values between 130, ,000 p1/kg. About 70-95 % of this gas occur in the headspace fraction. Both headspace and occluded hydrocarbons in this interval show quite dry composition (wetness <0.2 % and <3.7 %, respectively). The C5+ hydrocarbons show relatively low concentrations of maximum 390 p1/kg. Iso- butane is more abundant than n-butane as it is often observed in diagenetic-biogenic gases.

Such moderate aromaticity of the pyrolysate is not unusual for marine type-II or type-II-III kerogens which contain significant contribution of land-plant derived or- ganic material. Vitrinite reflectance data were obtained from six samples from the lower part of the cored section where terrestrial organic material predominates (86.21, 90.33, 95.74, (2 samples), and m). The values range from to %Ro (mean value %Ro) and indicate that the organic material is thermally immature. Most of the measurements have not been taken on vitrinite scum strictu, but rather on the brown coal equivalents textinite and ulminite, and they are about %Ro lower than the values obtained from the Triassic cores in Block 7230/05 discussed above. Immaturity is also indicated by the greenish-yellow to yellow fluorescence colours of the sporinite, the spore colour (TAI = 3.0-3.5), and also with the Tmax values which usually are in the range of 425 to 430C. The Tmax values in the Kimmeridgian section (Unit C) are markedly depressed (401-414C) and reflect the more hydrogen-rich nature of the kerogen rather than lower maturity. A total of thirteen samples was extracted in order to examine the nature of the extractable organic matter (EOM) present in the rocks (Figure 18.21), ,The lowest EOM concentrations were recorded in Unit (62-185 ppm of rock wt), and the highest yields were found in the black shales of Unit (4644-18,252 ppm), while Unit A. showed intermediate values (1014-2972 ppm). The extractability follows approximately the total organic carbon content of the rocks, as it can be seen in the TOC-relat- ed extract yields which range from 10 to 90 mg/g TOC, except for two samples with yields around 200 mg/g TOC (98.09 and m). Non-hydrocarbons typically account for 70 to 95 % of the total EOM, and aromatic hydrocarbons are more abundant than saturated hydrocarbons. This type of EOM composition is often associated with thermally immature organic rich rocks. The TOC-related hydrocarbon concentration is at maximum 15 mg HC/g TOC. Gas chromatograms for the saturated hydrocarbon fractions from the samples from the sandy-silty Units A and show rather immature distribution pattern. predominance of heavy compounds in the C- number range between C25 and C33 and strong predominance of odd- over even-numbered n-alkanes (CPI= 1.0-1.9; Figure 3.8.22) is typical of many of the samples. The isoprenoid compounds pristane and phytane occur in moderate concentrations, and pristane predominates over phytane which is common for organic matter which was deposited in dysoxic to oxic environment. The gas chromatograms of the aromatic hydrocarbon fractions show large and broad 'humps' of unresolved compounds and relatively well developed phenanthrene and methylphenanthrene peaks. In addition, number of prominent peaks elute in the region of the 3- to 5-ring compounds. The alkylated naphthalenes are missing or only minor and may have been affected by evaporation losses during the laboratory procedure.

The gas chromatogram of the aromatic fraction is dominated by large 'hump' but otherwise shows only minor peaks. The gas chromatograms of the extract fractions of the black shales of Unit show characteristic features of immature hydrocarbons derived from mixed marine-terrestrial source. The saturated fractions are characterised by bimodal n-alkane distributions with maxima at C15_17 and C27_29, by strong odd-over-even predominance (CPI= 1.2-2.2), pronounced 'hump' of unresolved compounds in the region C25-C33, and high concentrations of acyclic isoprenoids with carbon numbers between C14 and C20. Pristane and phytane are the predominating peaks. Phytane occurs in higher or at least equal concentrations as pristane, which suggests that the organic material was deposited under strongly anoxic conditions (Lijmbach 1975). The gas chromatograms of the aromatic fractions show very pronounced characteristic 'hump' of unresolved methyl-, dimethyl-, and C3-naphthalenes in about equal concentrations. All chromatograms are dominated by peak in the sterane-terpane regiop. which was tentatively identified as monoaromatic sterane (base peak at nt/z 253). This compound has been observed earlier in extracts from Kimmeridgian claystones frorn,the Barents Sea and appears to be characteristic for this strati- graphic unit. Biomarker data were obtained for the saturate fractions of each one sample from the Units and and of five samples from Unit C. The sample from Unit (123.92 m) shows sterane distribution which is dominated by the C29 14cc(H),17a(H) and 1413(11),1713(11) regular steranes (peaks t, r), while rearranged steranes (peaks a-i), which usually occur at higher maturity, are very minor. The terpane composition is dominated by 17(H)-hopane (E) and 17cc(11)-homohopane (11). strong predominance of hopane (E) over moretane (G), and of the biologically preferred 22R-extended hopanes (H, J2) over the thermally stable 22S-diastereomers (G, J1) indicates immaturity. Two significant peaks which elute in the m/z 191 mass fragmentogram between 17cc(H) trisnorhopane (B) and 17c414) norhopane (C) bisnorhopane (Z). The latter compound has been found in different oils and sediment extracts from the North Sea (Volkman et at. 1983) and the Barents Sea (Leith, pers. comm.) and is most prominent in the sample at m, which also shows the most pronounced terrestrial character of the whole series (high C29013-sterane content, high CPI). The biomarker pattern of the oil stain at is completely different from the pattern described above. The sterane composition is characterised by high proportion of rearranged steranes (diasteranes, peaks a-h) and C21 and C22501(11)-steranes. The conversion of cm- into 1313- and of 20R- into 20S-steranes at C29, respectively, is much more advanced than in the other samples of this core, but have not yet reached the equilibrium values of mature extracts. well developed peak of 28-30 AB7/shall 87/lioval/284/eins/19-MAR-88\", 'Passage_id': 172}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7230/5-U-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: a..5) TOC 2: -287- SI + S2 HI mg HC/g rock mg 11C/4 Soc C.:1/(Si S2)) T IAn ; T r 1 . _ .. \\\\ .167 a 3, J3.13.0 ../ 40- 14 , 40.5,... 1' 1isolated plant frgints. isolated / / plant frgmts. \\\\  a dark clayeysiltstone huninae co CD IC] _ NTEF-GRUPPEN Figure 3.8.20 Field and composition of headspace/occluded gas of core 7230/05-U-02.

The depositional character changed through time, and while semi regional deepening from shore to deeper shelf was established during some periods, larger or local basins may have been present in other time intervals. Nevertheless the following facies groups may be recognized throughout the succession. It is stressed that they do not need to have the same spatial interrelationships as this is dependent on the overall depositional setting and basin configuration in the corresponding time. The summary on Figure 4.3 is only schematic, but is meant to indicate some of the facies relationships. The major facies types are listed below. Clastic Shelf: This facies is sandstone dominated, but contains some carbonates, mostly limestone, but also dolomites are present. Fossils, and/or trace fossils show open marine affinity. Unit Assignments: Unit of core 7030/03-U-01 Unit and Unit of core 7129/10-U-01 Carbonate Shelf: This is the mostwidely distributed facies preserved in the studied cores, but contains several subfacies that are transitional to other facies groups. The facies is dominated by limestone but may contain some dolomite or siliciclastic input. Open marine fossils are abundant. Unit and Unit of core 7030/03-U-01 Unit and Unit of core 7129/10-U-02 Carbonate Buildups: The facies consists of carbonate boundstones, that may have formed local buildups. Unit and parts of Unit of core 7030/03-U-01 Parts of Unit of core 7129/10-U-02 Shallow Carbonates: The facies mostly consists of dolomite, but limestones, mostly fine grained, are also present. The fauna often shows restricted development, although open marine forms may be present. The deposit may represent local basin or restricted water circulation conditions. The facies also relates to evaporitic conditions.

The core hole also penetrated sequence boundary (9) which coincides with the junction of Units and of this core. Coastal plain deposits in the upper part of Unit with subaerial exposures and subsequent erosion are consistent with the truncational seismic boundary, upon which later flooding has led to the deposition of subtidal deposits. Core U-04 shows no evidences of intermediate facies between the subtidal and the continental deposits. A pronounced and possible major sequence boundary (X) is found between core holes U-04 and U-03 and tentatively dated as Carnian. Disturbances by faulting make detailed observations ambiguous but truncation and onlapping signatures can be attributed to this boundary which can be picked up on the conventional seismic record. Four Norian/Rhaetian sequence boundaries (it, p, and t) can be identified on seismic line IKU- 302230-87. There is one significant boundary (It) just below the core hole U-03 and another (p) coincides with the junction of Units and where erosional features of possible continental origin can be seen. Dating by fossils indicates that the unconformity (p) developed in Norian-Rhaetian times. This (p) or more likely, the underlying sequence boundary ,(rt) may correspond to regional fall in sea level in Late Norian time (Haq et al. 1986). Unit consists of coarse to medium grained sandstones (mouth bars/distributary channel) with subordinate marine bay fill siltstones, deposited in braided river deltaic environments. The aggregational stacking of the sandstones indicates an equilibrium between the sediment accumulation and the relative rise of sea level in Rhaetian time. A minor sequence boundary (a) which is found within Unit is consistent with the shift from the marine transgressive sediments to the fluvial influenced progradational deposits. The upper Triassic deposits were in large related to barrier sandstone facies with probable large and very extensive tidal flats/coastal plains and large unbarred embayments. schematic cartoon of rele- vant environment is shown in Figure 4.6. Sedimentation rates may have been high and the recovered deposits may represent limited time range. The Triassic - Jurassic boundary identified in core U-03 at the junction between Units and C, coincides with major sequence boundary (t). This boundary (T) can definitely be identified on con- ventional seismic data. The subcrop patterns of this boundary is illustrated on the bedrock map in Figure 4.4. Hettangian and Sinemurian shallow marine clayey siltstones and white sandstones of Unit were deposited in marginal marine environments. The seismic data indicates substantial channeling in this unit which may be lateral equivalent to the Nordmela Formation. Core U-02 represents sediments accumulated during significantly longer period than any of the Triassic cores. Three major sequence boundaries (4), and 4i) can be identified in the core interval in addition to major boundary (w) just above. The seismic units coincide with the three litho-units A, and C.

In core U-03 lithic to feldspatic arenites of Unit are overlain by the quartz arenites of Unit C. In core U-02 Unit A, which is interpreted as continuation of Unit of core U-03, shows interbedding of quartz arenites and feldspatic arenites with clayey and silty matrix as an important component and/or rooted beds. The overlying Unit contains significant amounts of glaucony and pelletoids which reduces the permeability. There are many similarities in the diagenesis of the different units such as early precipitation of siderite, pyrite and titanium oxide, some mechanical compaction, kaolinitization and/or illitization of matrix, micas and feldspars and precipitation of potassium feldspar, quartz and kaolinite. The extent of the diagenetic processes is, however, controlled by the original elastic composition of the units or beds thereby introducing different reservoir properties. A porosity - permeability plot of Late Triassic and Jurassic sandstones is shown in Figure 4.10. The porosity partly exceeds 25 % and the permeability is usually higher than 10 mD. Lower porosity and permeability were mainly caused by high primary.mairix content (Jurassic sandstones) or high content of late diagenetic calcite in the Triassic sandstones). The well sorted Late Triassic sandstones in core U-03 have in general lower po,cosity, and particularly lower permeability than the well sorted Jurassic sandstone. This is probably caused by the higher content of authigenic clay minerals in the Triassic sandstones. Despite the lower permeability of Late Triassic sandstones, they have higher reservoir potential than the Jurassic sandstone. This is due to the high content of well sorted sandstones (85 %) in Unit in U-03 and that the braided river deltaic sandstones bodies are more likely to be stacked upon each other both laterally and vertically. The Jurassic deltaic sandstones consist of isolated well sorted sandstone bodies in bioturbated and/or rooted clayey/silty sandstones. The chance for the different sandstone bodies to have direct contact is lower than for the Triassic braided river deltaic sandstone. However, the permeability of some of the bioturbated/rooted sandstones may be high enough to allow hydrocarbon migration during production.

Although this planktonic foraminiferal assemblage occurs within the uppermost Palaeocene sediments, its occurrence is normally associated with an Early Eocene age. It is suggested that the planktonic foraminifera are derived from thin sequence within the earliest Early Eocene which has become mixed with Palaeocene sediments as result of caving.

The age of these sediments is based on the following: - the stratigraphic position. - the general microfauna. The nannofossil evidence does suggest however that an early Maastrichtian - late Campanian age is more appropriate but this is not considered likely from our regional experience. Environment - marine, general shelf. Chalky limestone persists as the dominant lithology down into this interval. It is firm to hard, white to pale yellowish orange and occasionally moderate brown, slightly earthy, cryptocrystalline and weakly to moderately chalky. The moderate brown staining may be due to the presence of oil. The uppermost sample of this interval yielded poor to moderate microfauna but the samples below this proved to be poorly fossiliferous. Common specimens of Pseudotextularia elegans elegans occur at 10480' but P. elegans fructicosa and Globotruncana contusa are absent. This feature taken in conjunction with the appearance of the Rugoglobigerina/Archaeoglobigerina complex suggests that the Maastrichtian interval is present. The evidence for the age of these sediments is very poor and has been assigned essentially on the poorly fossiliferous nature of the interval which is regional feature. The nannofloras recovered from this interval contain low to moderate numbers of forms which suggest general Maastrichtian - late Campanian age. The appearance of Reinhardtites levis from 10500', however, suggests that the sediments may be of early Masstichtian age although this does conflict with the microfaunal evidence.

LITHOLOGY This interval consists of hard to very hard, white to very light grey and pale red, brittle, cryptocrystalline, slightly chalky limestones. The lithologies from 11850' to 13320' represent the Hod Formation of the Chalk Group. The boundary is tentatively placed at 11850' due to minor log break, because the Hod Formation is less pure than the overlying Tor Formation. Regional studies show the lower boundary can range in age from Maastrichtian to Santonian although Deegan and Scull (1977) only recognise it as being as old as late Campanian. MICROPALAEONTOLOGY A slight improvement in the microfaunas is apparent at 11720' although few significant forms appear. The consistent occurrence of Tritaxia dubia within the interval indicates that these sediments are no younger than the early Campanian. The more consistent presence of radiolaria also suggests that these sediments are likely to be of Santonian - Turonian age. The appearance of Stensioina praeexsculpta, and the virtual absence of species of Globorotruncana, suggest that the age can be restricted to the Santonian.

This section was then drilled to TD with the same bit size and two more MDT tool strings were deployed on wireline from the 15th to the 17th of Mar 2019. This section was drilled with Water Based Mud (WBM). The XPT run (Run 1B) was performed to obtain formation pressures using Standard probe (STD). Pressures were evaluated from MD to MD. The MDT run (Run 1C) was performed to obtain formation pressures, acquire formation fluid samples and conduct Interval Pressure Transient Test (IPTT). The MDT tool string included an Extra-Large-Diameter probe (XLD). An InSitu Fluid Analyzer (IFA) was used for fluid identification. The formation pressure was evaluated from MD to m MD. total of six samples were acquired during this run: three water samples at MD (file no. 2) and three oil and gas mixed with WBM filtrate samples at MD (file no. 9). Interval Pressure Transient Tests were conducted at these same depths. After drilling to TD, the first MDT run (Run 2D) was performed to obtain formation pressures, acquire formation fluid samples and conduct Interval Pressure Transient Test. The MDT tool string included an Extra-Large-Diameter probe, Standard probe and Saturn probe (Saturn). An InSitu Fluid Analyzer was used for fluid identification. The formation pressure was evaluated from MD to MD. total of four samples were acquired during this run: two water samples at MD (file no. 13), one water and hydrocarbon sample at MD (file no. 10) and one water and hydrocarbon sample at MD (file no. 9). Interval Pressure Transient Tests were conducted at m MD (file no. 13). The second MDT run (Run 2E) was performed to obtain formation pressures. The MDT tool string included an Extra- Large-Diameter probe, Standard probe and Saturn probe. An InSitu Fluid Analyzer was used for fluid identification. The formation pressure was evaluated from MD to MD. All Wireline depth measurements were referenced to the drill floor which was located 25 above Mean Sea Level. Depths for all stations in Run 1B and 1C were correlated with Run 1A FMI(HD)-PPC-MSIP-PPC-GR-JAR dated 1st of Feb 2019. Depths for all stations in Run 2D and 2E were correlated with Run 2A HRLA-NEXT-PEX-HNGS-GR-JAR dated 14th of Feb 2019. Operational Aspects: In Run 2D, after station file no. 13, the toolstring was stuck. After jar was fired several times, the toolstring was recovered. Run 2E commenced after this run with no further issues. Pretests Interpretation Summary Formation pressures were evaluated at 43 stations. On three pumping stations, the main flow period were included to present formation pressure and drawdown mobility. For four of pumping stations, the STD was set as observation probe and pretests were conducted. Therefore, total of 50 pretests are presented in this report. All pretests were processed and evaluated using InSitu Pro software. Only data from the quartz gauge was used for interpretation, although the strain gauge compared well. Test qualities and color codes were distributed as:  High  Medium  12 Low (Supercharged)  28 Ungraded (Tight, No Seal) Gradient Interpretation Summary The following gradients were identified from the formation pressure measurements: A water gradient corresponding to density of g/cm was calculated between MD (file no. 17) and 2137.4 MD (file no. 10), with statistical error of 0.069 g/cm and theoretical error of 0.046 g/cm 3. In Run 1B, mud gradient corresponding to density of g/cm was calculated from the hydrostatic pressure reading of all test points with the Std Gauge. This value compared well with the mud density of g/cm stated in the mud report.

Objectives The main objective of 34/8-A-5 was to acquire data to optimise the location of the horizontal section A-5 AH, and to serve as data point for later geological and geophysi- cal modeling, including: -structural depths for seismic mapping calibration -location of the FWL(s) -definition of the reservoir pressure(s) and fluid types(s) present, in order to evaluate reservoir communications -to acquire log data for the geological modelling and petropysical parameter mapping The objective of the horizontal oil producer 34/8-A-5 AR was to ensure maximum drainage of the Central area of the Staffjord/Amundsen-S1 compartment. Results 34/8-A-5 was drilled to TD without any major operational problems, except for the loss of the realtime communication between the ADN and the MWD. The reservoir was found 26m higher than prognosed. The Free Water Level (FWL) was found 22m higher than prognosed, at 3048m TVD MSL. The wireline logs, DSI/MDT (pressure points, oil/water samples), was run without any problems, except for tool failure with the consequence of only one oil sample being taken. The 34/8-A-5 AH was kicked off at 3775m MD. Two trips had to be made, mainly related to damaged bits. walkaway VSP was run successfully in cased hole. Due to unexpected throw direction on the fault that the well was planned to penetrate, the reservoir was located in the waterzone in the outer half of the horizontal section. Therefore it was decided to make sidetrack (i.e. -A-5 BR). The 34/8-A-5 BR was sidetracked from 34/8-A-5 AH at 4485m MD. One trip had to be made due to powerdrive failure. During one of the runs the neutron porosity sensor failed. The well encountered the FWL at 3070m TVD MSL and it was decided to make sidetrack (i.e. -A-5 CH) to penetrate the Upper Statfjord sands in the oil zone. the 34/8-A-5 CH was sidetracked from 34/8-A-5 BH at 5776m MD and drilled to TD at 6118m MD without any major problems.

In the observation well 34/8-A-5H Top Balder came in meter shallower, Top Cretaceous 11 meter deeper and Base Cretaceous meter shallower than prognosed. Top reservoir was encountered at 3033 TVD MSL, which was 26 meters shallower than prognosed. The difference in prognosed versus drilled depths are all within the estimated uncertainty range.

A seismic randomline along 34/8-A-5 CH and two inlines intersecting the well paths are shown in figure A-1.2 to A-1.4. Location of the seismic lines are shown in figure A1-5. Drilled wellpaths are posted on Top Statfjord structural depth maps (Fig-A.1.5). VSP Data The objective of the Walkaway VSP survey acquired in well 34/8-A-5AH, was to undershoot the high velocity calcite layers in the overburden in order to improve the seismic image for the reser- voir zone and provide time/depth relationship in the well. The survey was run in cased hole by READ Well Services on the 22nd of June 2000. Due to high deviation of the well, data were only acquired for the interval 0 MD RKB, with the deepest survey point in the Amundsen formation. The survey consisted of 25 shot lines, 12 lines parallel to the wellbore and 13 crosslines. The seismic source was 300 cuin Longlife airgun array. Average shot point distance was 25 meters. The receiver array consisted of three-component geophones in an array. The tool was anchored 12 times for total of 96 levels, which gave geophone spacing of 20 meters. A normal Incidence VSP dataset was extracted from the Walkaway VSP. Additionally, Normal Incidence checkshots were carried out with the main tool in the 3904 MD RKB position. Velocity Log Calibration DSI logging was performed over the interval 2580 to 5630 MD RKB.

However, post-depositional erosional truncation of the crestal area of the Visund fault block during the upper Jurassic rifting and fault block rotation, has removed major parts of the reservoir updip. Thinning and missing sections due to minor faults is also common feature in Visund wells due to the generally highly faulted structure. Well 34/8-A-5 H/AH/BH/CH was drilled on the Statfjord/Amundsen S1-segment, with 34/8-A-5 as an observation well and -A-5 AH as an downflank oil producer. The major fault that -A-5 AH was supposed to penetrate turned out to have an opposite throw direction (southern side of fault was down faulted instead of northern side). Therefore sidetrack (i.e. -A-5 BH) from -A-5 AH had to be made to position the well in the Upper Statfjord Formation above the FWL. The 34/8-A-5 BH penetrated FWL of 3070m TVD MSL in the toe section, motivating the last sidetrack (i.e. -A-5 CH) to position the last section of the well in the Upper Statfjord sands above the FWL. The need for MDT pressure samples and oil/water samples in 34/8-A-5 was motivated by the fact that the FWL was not penetrated by any of the earlier drilled exploration/appraisal wells. 2.2 Reservoir Zonation The current Statfjord/Amundsen reservoir zonation (created July 1999) on Visund comprises layers: Amundsen zones, upper Statfjord zones and lower Statfjord zones. The zonation of Wells 34/8-A-5 H/AH/BH/CH is shown in Enclosure 1, 3, and 7, and in Figures A-2.1 to A-2.4. Zone tops and thicknesses are listed in Table A-2.1 to A-2.4 (tops rounded off to nearest 0.5m). The Lower Statfjord Formation (Stan) is split into four reservoir zones: Stat121 This zone is dominated by medium- to very coarse-grained, poorly to moderately sorted sandstones. The -9S and -10S areas (see location map in the introduction) have got more accumulations of interchannel fines compared to what is seen in wells -4A and -A-5 H. This is interpreted as result of deep base Statfjord incision in the -4A and -A-5 H/AH area with deposition of sand, and coeval more floodplain like conditions in the -9S/-10S areas. The sandstones are interpreted as multistorey stacked channel deposits deposited in low accommodation setting. Stat1_2 This zone is dominated by mudstones and some minor sandstones. The few occurring sandstones range in grain-size from very fine- to very coarse-grained, with medium- grained sandstone being the most common sandstone lithology. They are interpreted as singlestorey channels, with the implication that the horizontal and vertical communication of this zone is very limited.

Contrary to Stat1_1 it is interpreted to be continuous sheet of sand, without any incisions/abrupt thickness variations. This zone is interpreted as multi- storey stacked channel deposits with good vertical and horizontal communication. Stat1_4 This reservoir zone is dominated by mudstones. The few sandstones range in grain-size from very fine to very coarse, interpreted as singlestorey channels. The horizontal and especially the vertical communication within this zone is expected to be poor. Even though Stat1_4 contains some sand, just as for the Stat 1_2, the sands are interpreted as isolated bodies, and the Stat1_4 zone is therefore most likely field wide barrier to fluid flow. The Upper Statfjord Formation is split into three reservoir zones: Stat2_1 The Stat 2_1 reservoir zone consists of fine- to very- coarse grained sandstones, with minor interchannel fines. The sandstones are interpreted as sheet of multistorey, stacked channel deposits, deposited in low accommodation setting. This has the impli- cation that both the vertical and horizontal communication is expected to be good within Stat2_1. In well 34/8-A-5 and -AH this zone has higher content of interchannel fines compared to exploration wells -4A and -10S. In well -10S parts of this zone is faulted out. Stat2_2 The Stat2_1 zone is dominated by grey claystone, coal, coaly shale and minor sandstones. The sandstones range in grain-size from very fine- to very coarse-grained. The horizontal and vertical permeabilities are 167 and 71 mD in the area around well -4A. Towards well -10S the reservoir properties are deteriorating with almost no Permeability in the -10S area, so that Stat2_2 most likely represents barrier to fluid flow between Stat2_1 and Stat2_3 in this area. The 34/8-A-5 wells show the same development as well -10S for this zone. Stat2_3 This zone is dominated by coarse to pebbly sandstones. The internal vertical and horizon- tal communication of this zone is expected to be very good from sedimentological point of view, however, the limited thickness of this zone makes it vulnerable for loosing self- juxtaposition across faults. The calcite layer at the base of Stat2_3 seen in wells -4A and -A-5 AH may have some lateral extent and be restriction to vertical communication with the Stat2_1 sand. In well -A-5 the lower meters of this zone consists of interchannel fines, while in wells -A-5 AH, -4A and -10S the entire zone consists of sand. The inter- channel fines in -A-5 most likely represents local clay accumulation. The Amundsen Formation is split into two reservoir zones: Am1_1 The entire Am1_1 zone consists of marine shales. This zone is not considered reservoir and represents barrier for horizontal and vertical flow. With thickness of more than 20m it also has the implication that fault with more than 20m throw is needed to create Amundsen1_2 - Statfjord2_3 sand to sand juxtaposition. Am1_2 This zone consists of fine to medium grained and poorly- to well sorted sandstones with intervals of silt and carbonate cement. fairly good internal horizontal and vertical communication is expected for the oil filled segments, however, the reservoir properties are expected to rapidly diminish away from the well -A-5, -4A, -10S, -9S area.

The lower Statfjord sediments show Sm/Nd provenance ages in the range of 1.7-2.3 Ga , whereas the upper Stafjord sediments have provenance ages in the range of 1.3-1.7 Ga (ref. /1/). This distinction between the upper and lower Statfjord could potentially be used in horizontal wells to get better assessment of the stratigraphy penetrated in areas where the structural picture is dubious due to poor seismic. This situation is general problem of the Statfjord reservoir on Visund. A Sm/Nd study was hence performed on cuttings samples from the horizontal section of A-5 CH, and also on samples from the observation well A-5 H, where the stratigraphy was known, in order to assess the validity of the method. As shown in the enclosed report (section 4), the A-5 Sm/Nd age range is very narrow throughout the stratigraphic section of the penetrated Statfjord Fm. and do not show the expected age distinction between the upper and lower Statfjord sediments. The fact that the A-5 H samples do not fit the standard mineral model applied for the XRD analysis show that these samples are not representative due to too much barite contamination. Considering the A-5 CH samples, these fit the XRD mineral model and should probably give representative picture of the provenance ages of these sediments. The results from the horizontal section given in the report and displayed in Figure A-2.5, show provenance ages in the range of 1.5-1.7 Ga down to 4900m, supporting the upper Statfjord interpretation of these sediments. From 4900m to 5500m the provenance ages jump to higher level of 1.8-2.3 Ga, suggesting that the lower Statfjord, i.e. structural horst, has been penetrated. In particular the ages above 1.9 Ga from 5300-5460m strongly suggest lower Statfjord sediments. Note that this jump in the provenance ages also corresponds with the diffusion barrier (i.e. fault) located between 5250-5300m implied by the change in the gas isotope data shown in Figure A-2.6. The structural implication of both these data sets are in conflict with the current seismic interpretation which have no horst at this location. However, the seismic is too poor to neither disclose nor support the Sm/Nd structural implication. This problem can hopefully be resolved by the walkaway VSP planned in Well A-23. The section from 5500-5950m show Sm/Nd provenance ages in the 1.5-1.7 Ga range, suggesting that upper Stafjord sediments again are penetrated.

The GR logs were corrected for bit size and mud weight. Density logs were corrected for stand-off and the neutron logs were corrected for bit size, mud weight, pressure, tempera- ture and salinity. The resistivity logs were borehole corrected but not invasion corrected. The log quality in the 8-1/2 sections is generally good except for the neutron log.

In these intervals the porosity and water saturation have been set to zero and one, respec- tively. Significant quantities of mica, feldspar and radioactive heavy minerals occur within the Amundsen and Statfjord Formations. The contribution of these minerals to the GR and neutron log responses can lead to overestimation of the shale volume and underestimation of the effective porosity if not taken into account. To compensate for the effects of these minerals, final shale volumes have been computed from log derived initial shale volume using the core correlated, nonlinear relationship presented in the Visund Petrophysical Field Study: Statfjord and Amundsen Group. The relationship is: 0.5* Vsh,min Vsh  1.5Vsh,min Vsh,n is the shale volume determined in standard manner by taking the minimum of the individual shale volumes from the density-neutron and linear gamma ray methods. The end point values used for the shale volume computation from GR and density neutron logs are listed in Table A-3.3. Due to intermittent failure of the LWD neutron tool, the neutron log is missing over many intervals of wells 34/8-A-5 AH, BH and CH. For these wells, has been computed using only the GR input. Porosity The total porosity was calculated from the density log with use of hydrocarbon correction in the oil and water zones. Oil based mud was used and as no microresistivity log was available, density log hydrocarbon correction was performed with the approximation that S,,=Sw. In the invaded zone sensed by the density log, hydrocarbons are mixture of formation oil and oil based mud filtrate in the oil zones, and oil based mud filtrate alone in the water zone. As an approximation, single apparent hydrocarbon density of g/cc was used. Implementation of hydrocarbon correction essentially compensates for the effects of variable degrees of filtrate invasion. However for the densities of the formation oil and oil based mud filtrate applicable here the hydrocarbon correction has little impact on the calcu- lated porosity. Total porosity was calculated from the density log using the relationship: Pma Pb 0E P.  P11 total porosity (fraction) P.

Water Saturation The dual water model saturation equation was used for computation of water saturations in the Statfjord and Amundsen formations. This model assumes two types of water with two corresponding conductivities: (i) bound water of conductivity Cwh, associated with clay surfaces, and (h) formation (free) water of conductivity Cw in the remaining pore space. When hydrocarbons displace free water, the conductivity of the hydrocarbon bearing sand is described by the equation: Car *Slit Ct = * [ Cw + Swt * (Cwb  Cw)] C, = C. = S.,= Swb = conductivity of the uninvaded zone {Sim = 1/(ohm.m)} formation water conductivity (S/m) total water saturation (fraction) bound water saturation (fraction) The total water saturation Sm, is derived from the above equation.

Shale volume was not included in the cutoff criteria. The cutoff limit applied for net sand designation is 13% effective porosity for the Statfjord Formation and 14 % effective porosity for the Amundsen Formation. The cutoff limits for net pay estimates are 13% effective porosity (14% Amundsen) and 60% effective water saturation.

The MDT tool was tubing conveyed (TLC) after the first attempt on wireline encountered sticking. Thirtynine pretests were attempted, 34 solely as pressure measurement operations and as part of sampling operations. The results from these 39 pretests are listed on table A-3.8. In general, the data are of good quality with occasional evidence of supercharging particularily in the water column. The COG formation pressure data from the 34 pressure pretests are plotted on figures A-3.4, A-3.5 and A-3.6. MDT sampling was carried out in the Lower Statfjord water column at MD RKB (3081.47 TVD MSL) following two unsuccessful attempts at RKB and 4293.42 RKB. one gallon sampling chamber (MRSC) and 250 cc sampling chambers (SPMC) were filled with formation water. large diameter probe was used for sampling. Sampling was also carried out in the Upper Statfjord oil column at RKB (3035.71 mTVD MSL) following an unsuccessful attempt at RKB. one gallon sampling chamber (MRSC) and 250 cc sampling chambers (SPMC) were filled with formation oil. 3.7 Fluid Contacts Fluid contacts in 34/8-A-5 have been determined from the formation pressure data and the resistivity log responses. Two separate oil columns are apparent, one in the Amundsen Formation and one in the Statfjord Formation. The oil-water contacts as determined from the MDT pressure data are TVD MSL, (4208.45 RKB Amundsen) and TVD MSL (4230.60 RKB Statfjord) . The pressure data and gradients for 34/8-A-5 are shown in figs A-3.4 and A-3.5 along with pressure data from other wells- in the Statfjord-Amundsen .segment. The equations used to define the 34/8-A-5 pressure gradients (bar/m) are: Pwat = 0.0975.TVD + Pod = 0.05833.TVD + (Statfjord) These gradients correspond to fluid densities of g/cc and g/cc for oil and 0.993 g/cc for water respectively. The water density is good fit to the recorded pressure data in 34/8-A-5 and is consistent with the water gradient of g/cc at 3100 TVD MSL derived for the Upper Statfjord aquifer in 34/8-9 S. The 34/8-A-5 Amundsen oil density is derived-froin best fit of the pressure data. The value of g/cc lies within the range - g/cc bounded by the 34/8-10 Amundsen PVT derived oil densities from MDT and DST samples respectively. The 34/8-A-5 Statfjord oil density of g/cc is consistent with the interpreted 34/8-4 Staffjord oil density of g/cc. The 34/8-A-5 pressure data show no evidence of pressure depletion in the Statfjord-Amundsen formations. The 34/8-A-5 aquifer appears to be same aquifer observed in wells 34/8-1 and 34/8-4 A.

Based on the data barriers to diffu sion, and fluid flow, are interpreted to exist at the following levels in the horizontal section of wells 34/8-A-5 AH/BH/CH: * Possibly between 4130 and 4133 * Possibly between 4270 and 4300 and between 4300 and 4410 - due to either A) drilling into coal or B) drilling through small fault block * Possibly at approximately 4500 * Possibly at approximately 5480 and 5770 The gas samples taken at the test separato rafter about one month production are similar to the gas in the heel section and different to the ones in the far end of the horizontal section, indicating that production occurs mainly rom the first part of the well. Production oil from well 34/8-A-5 correlates well with oils from the nearby wells 34/8-10S (Statfjord Fm.) and 34/8-4A (Statfjord/Lunde Fms.). With respect to thermal maturity, the produced oil is most similar to the oil from well 34/8-4A.

INTRODUCTION Well 30/6-E-15 was planned to be an oil producer from Etive formation in the eastern margin of Beta Saddle structure on the Oseberg st field. The objective of well 30/6-E-15A / E-15 AT2 was to produce oil from Etive formation in the eastern margin of Beta Saddle structure on the Oseberg st field. Due to stuck liner in the horizontal section in E-15 AT2 it was decided to redrill this section as wellbore 30/6-E-15 AT3. Location of the wells are shown on the Top Brent structural depth map in Figure A-1. 2. GEOPHYSICAL EVALUATION Well Results 30/6-E-15 / E-15A / E-15 AT2 / E-15AT3 The depth and position of formation tops compared with prognosis for wells 30/6-E-15 / E-15 / E-15 AT2 / E-15 AT3 are listed in Tables A-1a_1d. Seismic profile along the 30/6-E-15 / E-15 / E-15 AT2 / E-15 AT3 wellpaths is given in Figure A-2. The seismic section is along E-15 AT3 wellpath and the other three wellpaths are projected. For the prognosed formation tops that are based on seismic interpretation and depth conversion, Top Shetland, Top Draupne and Top Brent, the discrepancies between prognoses and actual depths are within +3 to -9 TVD MSL (see Table A-1a_1c) for wells E-15, E-15 and E-15 AT2, indicating that both seismic inter- pretation and the velocity model in that area are fairly accurate. In case of E-15 AT3 these discrepancies range between -6 to TVD MSL. The difference of -19.4m observed at Top Brent level is most probably due to additional faulting compared to seismic interpretation. For the other prognosed formation tops above Top Reservoir, depth maps are not generated. This is partly due to weak, discontinues or absent seismic signal along formation transitions, causing uncertainty in the seismic interpretation. The location of the wellpath in Etive was based on amplitude data. Figure A-3 shows reflection strength data from an amplitude data volume in Etive in map view and the wellpaths with the thin sand intervals in Etive delineated by high reflection strength values (red and yellow colors in map view).', 'Passage_id': 226}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/6-E-15 AT3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A-10 Petrophysical Results and Discussion Table A-4.3.1 and present the average petrophysical results for the Brent formations in welbores E-15 and E-15 AT3, respectively. The CPI is presented in Figures A-5.1 (E-15, MD), A-5.2 (E-15, TVD MSL) and A-5.3 (E-15 AT3, MD). CPI results together with raw logs are also given in Enclosure (E-15, MD), 2a (E-15, TVD MSL) and (E-15 AT3, MD), Geological Data Sheets. Wellbore E-15 contains MD of reservoir quality (net) sand of which 138.8 MD is interpreted as net pay sand. Wellbore E-15 AT3 contains MD of reservoir quality (net) sand of which MD is interpreted as net pay sand. Fluid System Operations / Data Quality Wireline Formation Tester MDT was run (run 1A) in wellbore E-15. The MWD gamma ray log is used as depth reference, and the wireline logs have been depth shifted for matching. 25 pressure points were recorded with BQP1 and BQP2 crystal gauge. of the tests were dry, leaving 17 valid records.

Opened the hole from 3411m MD to 5835 MD, with the Security Near Bit Reamer (NBR). Due to stuck liner and tight hole, the NBR was used to open/ream the hole of the 12 1/4 section to 13. The NBR is considered as low risk reamer since few moving parts can be lost in hole. Recommendation: Baker Hughes Inteq has not registered any negative influence on the steering of the AutoTrak, while running NBR in the assembly. The NBR was positioned behind the AutoTrak. The NBR can be set at shear value so the arms wont flex before its required, accordingly the pump rate must then be limited. The NBR will give an additional pressure loss, which can be compensated by increasing the flow area of the bit. In this case worn of the NBR was seen as clear indication on the torque. Status on the NBR after reaming the section: OD= 12 1/4 from approximately 5200 MD. ROP: The ROP would be the same as for drilling especially in harder formations, even if the NBR were running after the section is drilled. Time saving/ extended lifetime of reamers: The lifetime of the NBR is longer if its used simultaneously as drilling the section. For saving time the best way is to include the NBR while drilling. Shoe track: The previous casing shoetrack can be drilled out if desired, but caution should be taken since this easily will cut the casing if double cutting structure is chosen. By choosing cutter arms with only wear tads on gauge, the casing shoetrack can be drilled out with no risk of cutting the casing. The cutter arms can be pinned to shear at specific pressure, however the risk of cutting casing was found to be high, and the shoetrack was drilled out before adding the NBR to the BHA.

The petrophysical software GEOLOG is used to plot, interpret and summarize the results of the well logs obtained. Petrophysical functions have been implemented in GEOLOG to characterize water saturations in initial drainage, intermediate drainage, imbibitiion conditions, and final injection water breakthrough conditions. The water saturation final output is combination of these calculations as explained in the following paragraphs. The CPI plot has the intervals marked as to which calculation is used over that interval. (ex. DRAINAGE) 1.2.1 Prior to the interpretation, the gamma ray, neutron, density and DT curves are filtered to provide uniform resolution for all the logs and to eliminate spurious data points. The gamma ray log (GR) is used to calculate the shale volume (VSH) over the entire reservoir section. The volume of shale in the reservoir is minimal and therefore these calculations have little affect on the computed results (mainly porosity). A shale matrix corrected density porosity is calculated based on the density measurement. Corrected neutron porosity is obtained by using standard Baker Atlas environmental algorithms with the neutron measurement as input. Where the well is drilled with an oil base mud, the final porosity curve, PHIE, is calculated utilizing the wireline density - neutron logs with ratio of 5/7 and 2/7 respectively. fluid density of g/cc is used in the calculation which reflects the expected mud filtrate density of the oil based drilling fluid. In wells drilled with water based mud, fluid density of is used. 1.2.2 The initial step of determining the water saturation (Sw) of this well is by use of the standard procedure developed for Ekofisk, based on the assumption that all the formation intervals are believed to be at initial water saturation or drainage conditions. This procedure uses modified version of the Poupon equation, which takes into account the effect of clay on the resistivity measurement (minimal shale, minimal affect on resistivity). (drainage) Formation Temperature is predicted using the standard Ekofisk temperature gradient and estimated temperature/depth relationship. The deep resistivity curve is used as input curve in the water saturation calculations. Standard drainage Archie parameters derived for the Ekofisk field are for the entire interval. (see appendix A) 1.2.3 The next step of determining water saturation for the subject well is to recalculate SW for the breakthrough intervals. calculation of the Sw based on the core-derived imbibition endpoints (Nimb). Formation water is initially assumed to be present. (imbibition) A second estimation of Sw is made with some empirically derived values of (N_icf) applicable to intermediate breakthrough conditions in combination with correction factor (X_icf). (Ref. Ekofisk Field 1999 Revision Report). (icf)', 'Passage_id': 246}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-X-17 T2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The water saturation to use in given interval is selected, based on whether the ICF-derived value exceeds threshold water saturation, initially determined as the water saturation end-points for the actual geological layer. When the ICF-derived saturation exceeds the threshold value, then the final saturation is taken from the value calculated by the imbibition end-point saturation exponent. ICF-derived saturations less than the threshold values indicate incomplete (intermediate) water breakthrough and are chosen for the water saturation output. 1.2.4 If significant temperature anomaly is apparent from the cased hole temperature log then we designate this zone as at imbibition conditions with injection water as the fluid present in the formation (i.e. Rw=.068 at formation). This is an indication that number of pore volumes of seawater (injection water) has flushed the well bore area. The interval is likely very near the residual end point saturation. The estimations of water saturation in the water flooded intervals are made assuming only injection water Rw is present in the formation. (imb_swtr) 1.2.5 The final water saturation curve is composite of the calculations over the complete and partial breakthrough intervals and the standard calculations over non flooded intervals. In addition consideration is given to the probable water types present in the various intervals. The optimal method for picking the selection of intervals is based on the CPI calculations and the estimate of expected water saturations based on the Ekofisk Field model (Swj analysis). Water saturation from the Ekofisk Swj model correlates the formation water saturation with porosity, permeability and height above an estimated free water level to predict what the Sw should be in the various layers. 1.2.6 Appendix is the summary of the data acquisition for the well. Appendix contains the outline listing of the petrophysical parameters and Appendix is reservoir summary over the well in measured depth A measured depth mini-CPI with tvd-subsea annotations is included as Appendix D. The saturation calculations are presented on the CPI plot. The input parameters used to calculate water saturation are listed in Appendix B. Appendix also contains columns to show each interval over which the appropriate parameters are used. Imbibition for imbibition parameters, Drainage for drainage parameters and Sea water when Sea water is assumed to be the water in the interval, and in the case of intermediate flooding the ICF parameters are applied.', 'Passage_id': 247}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 16/5-7 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Table of Contents 1.

The gradient analysis has showed two gradients, one for oil with bar/m and water with 0.097 bar/m. However, the three pumping stations carried out did not show any presence of hydrocarbons that could be visible in IFX, this can be attributed to the fact that fractures observed in the reservoir could be saturated with water or WBM filtrate.

Pump-out started right away without performing any drawdown test. Fluid was pumped out at ~3cc/s and it was kept constant for the whole station. PVT tanks were filled at this station. During this third try fluid monitoring were carried out using the IFX in real time to assess fluid cleanliness. Sensors such as:  Optical Density (OD): during the pump-out channels subtraction of OD 13-14 and OD 15- 16 were carried-out. Reading from Optical density channels subtraction were trending close to for OD13-14 indicative of water and OD15-16 was trended close suggestive the lack of hydrocarbon.  Refractive index (RI): During the real time, clean up was trended around 1.4.  Fluorescence was low characteristic on presence of water.  TF density started with value of g/cc and after 50 minutes, TF Density decreased to g/cc. Before the tanks were filled density value was around g/cc to g/cc.  Sound Speed were observed during the whole pump-out and the sensor readings was 185 us/ft Based on sensor responds it can be mention that no hydrocarbon was observed during the whole pump-out.

No positive evidence is encountered to indicate the occurrence of Lower Paleocene strata. The relationship between palynofloral Subzone PP4C and Subzone PP3E is somewhat uncertain due to the prevalence of assumed reworked material in the sidewall cores at 2168m and 2176m. The former sidewall core comprises 100% upper Callovian material, whilst the latter comprises 100% Lower Jurassic (probably lower Pliensbachian). Although interpreted as reworked, it is perhaps possible that the sidewall cores may have been mis-shot; it may be that minor intra-Upper Paleocene hiatus is present c. 2190m. PALAEOENVIRONMENT Impoverished benthonic assemblages and pyritised diatoms indicate bathyal deposition with dysaerobic bottom conditions above 2041m. Below 2041m the reappearance of grey-green agglutinated foraminifera indicates deposition in middle - lower bathyal depositional setting. MICROPALAEONTOLOGY Recovery/Sample quality: 1930m-2041m: poor. 2059m-2313m: generally poor to moderate. SWCs over this interval are generally poor or barren.

The log break which marks the top of the Cromer Knoll Group, Rodby Formation occurs at 2355m(log). The Rodby Formation is regionally of Lower Cretaceous Albian age, supported only by evidence in the subsequent ditch cuttings sample examined at 2359m. Very good. Good. The sample at 2356m(SWC) yielded very high diversity, well preserved assemblage dominated by superabundant Watznaueria barnesae and Tranolithus phacelosus. Biscutum constans and Broinsonia enormis/signata also occur abundantly. The occurrence of Calculites anfractus restricts the age of the sample to the lowermost Cenomanian Zone NUK18. This is supported by the presence of Seribiscutum primitivum, Rothia bergeni' RRI and abundant Biscutum constans.

Oligosphaeridium complex occurs in abundance at 1869.0m and has its last downhole appearance at 1880.0m an event occurring within the top of the Early Valanginian Endoscrinium pharo Biozone (Swiecicki et al. 1984, Paley et al. 1988). The queried presence of Surculosphaeridium sp.II Davey 1982 at 1869.0m also suggests Lower Valanginian age. The sample at 1885.0m contains taxa characteristic of, but not restricted to, the Late Ryazanian including Gochteodinia villosa, ?Oligosphaeridium diluculum, Egmontodinium expiratum, Systematophora palmula and common Apteodinium spp. and Surculosphaeridium spp. Tbe sample is also characterised by robust forms of Tubotuberella apatela; these robust forms have been recorded elsewhere as latest Ryazanian from Arctic Canada and Spitsbergen (Evans 1988). Considerable reworking is also present in this sample from the Kimmeridgian or older (Gonyaulacvsta iurassica) and from the Bajocian /Toarcian (Nannoceratopsis senex and Parvocysta spp.). The rather poor assemblage from 1890.0m also contains -reworked Kimmeridgian elements (Gonyaulacysta perforans and Scriniodinium crystallinum). These samples at and below 1885.0m may belong to the Late Ryazanian Parvocavatus spinosus or Hystrichosphaerina sarjeantii Biozones (Swiecicki et al. 1984, Paley et al. 1988), but lack the nominative taxa. However, Canningia spp., which first appear in the P. spinosus Biozone (Paley et al. 1988), are recorded from 1885.0m and 1869.0m. Systematophora palmula, which has its first downhole appearance in the underlying H. sarjeantii Biozone (Paley et al. 1988), is recorded from 1885.0m and ?1890.0m. The possibility of reworking for any or all of these taxa poses problems in assigning the in-house biozones to this interval. The sediments are probably of Early Valanginian to Late Ryazanian age and possibly encompass the E. pharo, P. spinosus and H. sarjeantii Biozones of Swiecicki et al. Aze: Indeterminate (Ryazanian to Kimmeridgian) (Gearhart: Ryazanian- Kimmeridgian) Comments: This interval is defined between two log breaks which also mark palynofacies breaks. The two sidewall cores analysed from the interval show major influx of amorphous organic matter together with chlorophycean algae (Tasmanites spp. and ?Pterospermella spp.); this palynofacies is characteristic of sediments of Ryazanian to Kimmeridgian age. The very low numbers of palynomorphs included no age diagnostic taxa. microfaunal change recorded at 1894m is marked by the incoming of mixed calcareous benthic foraminifera/agglutinated benthic foraminifera/radiolarian assemblage typical of Ryazanian-Kimmeridgian sediments and appearing at the top of the Hekkingen Formation in the Barents Sea area (Evans 1988). Haplophragmoides canui and Trochammina cf. gryci become abundant at 1899m. The log break at 1904m also marks major palynofacies break with an influx of woody kerogen and saccate pollen at 1907.0m.', 'Passage_id': 288}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7219/9-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: - 70 - A.g: Early Oxfordian (Gearhart: Early Oxfordian-Callovian) Biozone: Gonyaulacysta scarburghensis Comments: Following wireline log break at 1904m, palynofacies break recorded at 1907.0m shows an influx of woody kerogen and bisaccates with abundant Cerebropollenites mesozoicus. Microplankton are abundant although restricted in assemblage composition. The two sidewall cores analysed from this interval yield assemblages with common Chytroeisphaeridia spp., Sirmiodinium grossii, Chlamydophorella spp., Pareodinia ceratophora, Sentusidinium spp. and Atopodinium spp. Gonyaulacysta jurassica is rare to common and Rhynchodiniopsis cladophora is present. G. scarburghensis (as Acanthaulax senta) is recorded in low numbers in both samples indicating the presence of the Early Oxfordian G. scarburghensis Biozone (Paley, 1986; Paley et al. 1988). The nominative taxon becomes common in the middle of the biozone; this event has not been recorded. General comments: Although Nannoceratopsis pellucida occurs at 1909.0m it becomes abundant at 1917.0m indicating the presence of the N. pellucida Biozone of Early Callovian age (see below). large biostratigraphic gap appears to exist between the two sidewall core samples at 1909.0m and 1917.0m; there is no evidence for the presence of the Early Oxfordian Wanaea fimbriata, Late Callovian Mendicodinium groenlandicum and Callovian Chytroeisphaeridia dictydia Biozones (Paley, 1986; Paley et al. 1988). Parvocysta barbarata (Aalenian/Toarcian) is apparently reworked at 1907.0m. Age: Early Callovian ?-Early Bathonian (Gearhart: Early Callovian- Bathonian) Biozone: Nannoceratopsis pellucida Comments: The top of this interval is marked by biostratigraphic break between sidewall core samples at 1909.0m and 1917.0m. At this level abundant N. pellucida together with common Chytroeisphaeridia spp., Scriniodinium spp., Escharisphaeridia spp. and Sentusidinium spp. appear. Middle to Early Oxfordian-Late Callovian taxa are absent (i.e. G. scarburghensis, Wanaea spp.) and R. cladophora is rare. Three sidewall cores and nine cores were analysed from this interval; assemblages are rather similiar in composition and are characteristic of the Early Callovian N. pellucida Biozone (Paley, 1986; Paley et al. 1988). An impoverished microfauna of agglutinating foraminifera including Haplophragmoides canui indicates an Early Callovian to Bathonian age for the interval according to Gearhart. The base of the interval is placed by Gearhart at log break at 1950.5m and accompanying palynofacies break at 1949.50m (driller/logger discrepancy). However, around the level of this break four core samples between 1948.00m-1950.00m yield slightly', 'Passage_id': 289}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7219/9-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: - 77 - presented in the Gearhart _report and Bathonian biozones cannot be definitely recognised. In the interval 1950.5m (log break) to 2057.55m an Early Bajocian to Late Pliensbachian age has been assigned by Gearhart. An influx of Nannoceratopsis spp. at 1950.5m allows the recognition of the N. senex Biozone of Early Bajocian age. The Aalenian- Toarcian Parvocysta complex Biozone is tentatively recognised at 1984.5-2030m and the abrupt last downhole occurrence of Nannoceratopsis spp. in core at 2057.55m is taken by both BP and Gearhart to indicate the well-known widespread Late Pliensbachian event. The interval 2061.47m-2240m is designated undifferentiated Early Jurassic by Gearhart; the present study recognises the top of the Pliensbachian-?Sinemurian Cerebropollenites cf. thiergartii Biozone at 2061.47m and the Hettangian Ricciisporites tuberculatus Biozone between 2203.5-2240m. 6. The incoming at 2250m of Triassic spores is taken as the top of the Rhaetian by Gearhart and BP in the absence of microplankton. The Rhaetian Limbosporites lundbladii Sub-biozone of the Camarozonosporites rudis (Cr) Biozone is recognised between 2250m- 2487m and the Norian Protodiploxypinus gracilis (Pg) Sub-biozone of the same biozone between 2487m-2940m. In addition the Heibergella asymmetrica microplankton assemblage characteristic of Norian to Late Carnian sediments is recognised between 2676m- ?3520m. Gearhart assigns slightly older ages to these levels (Figure 7.1). The Carnian Camerosporites secatus Biozone is recognised at 2954m. Gearhart place the top of the Carnian slightly lower in the succession at 3297m. Evidence for older biozones is lacking; however there is some indication of pre- Carnian sediments towards the base of the borehole.', 'Passage_id': 290}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7219/9-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH:  c 4.

Drilling mud used contains KCI. Detailed QEM SCAN, SEM and XRD clay fraction analyses 8 samples have been selected to run QEMSCAN and SEM Photos Summary of the results equinort Samples from 640mMD until 1000mMD consists mainly of illite with minor amounts of quartz, plagioclase, na- kalifeldspar. Minor amounts of smectite, chlorite, muscovite, glauconite carbonates and pyrite are present. Samples 1100mMD and 1140mMD consists mainly quartz with more than 70 vol%. In addition minor amounts of illite, na-kalifeldspar plagioclase, glauconite and carbonates are present. Traces of smectite and pyrite are present. Sample 1220mMD contains mainly illite, smectite, quartz and carbonates (calcite). Traces of chlorite, muscovite, glauconite and pyrite are identified. Since the samples have been in contact with KCI rich drilling mud the measured content of the swelling clay is underestimated. The mineral quantification of the samples represents the amount of swelling clay (smectite) after the reaction with KCI that typically reduces the swelling capacity. To be able to detect any fossils in the sample, SEM photos have been done. Those are shown in the report. XRD clay fraction results show that sample 1220m has the highest swelling capacity, followed by 1140m, and 1100m. Sample 740m shows no swelling and sample 640m indicates traces of swelling material. A quantitative comparison between Qemscan analyses and XRD clay fraction is not possible. For Qemscan data all of the material has been used, so quantification by Qemscan is possible. For XRD clay fraction only the clay fraction of the sample has been used, while all the other minerals present in the sample have been removed before the actual measurement.', 'Passage_id': 293}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 16/2-D-18 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Smectite IN lo ; Ii 16/2-D-18 1220mMD [vol percent] cL  .-?V,J.I'Wj't - :11    ;V: '4-%,04. w .

Samples over the interval from 1300m to 2865m were analysed for micropalaeontology and palynology. Analysis commenced in the Hordaland Group, within the Early Oligocene at 1300m and the sequence is considered to be complete to the Oligocene / Eocene boundary at 1650m. significant hiatus is interpreted from the biostratigraphic data between 1650m and 1675m, where no strata of definitively Late Eocene age were encountered. complete sequence for the remaining Hordaland Group from the Middle to Early Eocene is recognised. The boundary between the Hordaland Group and the underlying Rogaland Group (prognoses at 2006.0, log) is suggested to lie between 2025m and 2050m on biostratigraphy and within the Early Eocene. The entire Balder Formation, the uppermost formation of the Rogaland Group, and the top of the Sele Formation are assigned as earliest Eocene, while the entire underlying Lista Formation and top of the Vale Formation are dated as Late Palaeocene). The Vale Formation continues into the Early Palaeocene. A significant stratigraphic break separates the Rogaland Group from the underlying Shetland Group between 2310m and 2320m, with sediments of Early Palaeocene age resting on those of Late Maastrichtian age. The Shetland Group ranges in age from Late Maastrichtian to Early Campanian. At (log) further major unconformity marks the boundary between the Shetland Group and the Dunlin Group below, encompassing the Santonian to ?Pliensbachian stages. The base of the Dunlin Group and Amundsen Formation is identified at 2667.5m (log) with the top of the underlying Statfjord Formation. The ?Pleinsbachian / Sinemurian boundary is suggested to lie between 2605m and 2610m within the Dunlin Group, and although the majority of this group could not be positively dated, it is probably entirely Sinemurian. Palynological evidence derived from the Statfjord Formation, tentatively suggests the interval from 2675m to 2694.0m is of Late Sinemurian age, and that the position of the Sinemurian / Hettangian boundary questionably lies between 2810m and 2815m. A detailed palaeoenvironmental analysis has been completed on this well based on combined micropalaeontological and palynological approach. Transitional conditions are suggested for the sediments at base of the well, and broadly regressive (or change to more non-marine conditions) phase is recognised into the mid-Statfjord formation. From this level to the top of the Statfjord Formation, an increase in sea-level is suggested, through transitional palaeoenvironment that resulted in the development of inner neritic, marine conditions in the uppermost Statfjord Formation. Broadly, the remaining Jurassic, Dunlin Group, is suggested to occupy transitional palaeoenvironment, but one that was more marine influenced than most of the underlying Statfjord Formation. In contrast, the Cretaceous and Tertiary sequences are of wholly marine origin. Middle neritic conditions are suggested for the Early Campanian that was shifted to outer neritic conditions by a marked transgression into latest Early Campanian. sharp regressive phase into the early Late Campanian resulted in the development of inner / middle neritic conditions. Excluding minor regressive phase in the late Late Maastrichtian, major transgression followed through the remaining Cretaceous sequence, resulting in the development of outer neritic conditions. Inner neritic conditions are envisioned for most of the overlying Palaeocene and early Eocene (Vale, Lista, Sele, lower Balder formations). sharp transgressive episode is recognised in the mid-Early Eocene through the remaining Balder Formations with the development of upper bathyal conditions. Sea-level remains high through the late Early Eocene with middle neritic palaeoenvironment, that under Middle Eocene transgression, was again replaced by upper bathyal conditions. broadly regressive phase is suggested for the overlying Oligocene, which', 'Passage_id': 297}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/6-26 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: PALYNOLOGICAL COUNTING PROCEDURE The standard Norsk Hydro counting procedure has been followed for semi-quantitative palynological analysis. The procedure consists of two counts; Count of 100 specimens describes the general (total) composition, whereas Count quantifies the dinocyst assemblage up to 100 specimens. Count 2 runs concurrently with Count 1. So, for assemblages consisting only of dinocysts, the total count would be 100 specimens. Count (100 specimens; 200 in Brent Group): - Dinocysts (count 1) entered as single taxon under MP category in StrataBugs; including identifiable and indeterminate specimens - Bisaccate pollen entered as single taxon, when appropriate At individual species/generic level: - Prasinophyceaen algae - Acritiarchs - Scolecodonts - Foraminiferal test-linings - Freshwater algae - Bisaccate pollen, when appropriate stratigraphically: - Other pollen - Spores - Indeterminate palynomorphs Reworked and caved taxa are considered as additional taxa (entered in StrataBugs as +). Where the reworking/caving is questionable, the numerical values are entered. Count (100 specimens): - Dinocysts, running concurrently with Count 1. As for Count 1, reworked and caved taxa are considered as additional taxa (entered in StrataBugs as +). Where the reworking/caving is questionable, the numerical values are entered. For the Brent Group (Middle Jurassic), and equivalents, counting is based on two counts, but Count continues up to 200 specimens.

The lithostratigraphic terminology is based on the work of Deegan and Scull (1977) and Volset and Dore (1984).

LITHOSTRATIGRAPHIC UNITS NORDLAND GROUP: 627m(SWC) (top not seen)-1412m (log); Age: Late Miocene to Middle Miocene The lithology of the Nordland Group consists of thick sequence of predominantly olive grey to olive black, soft to firm, blocky to subfissile, waxy, non-calcareous mudstones, with the only notable lithological change being as increase in consolidation with depth. Rare carbonate units, inferred from wireline logs only, are present towards the base of the group. Environment of deposition: The sub-interval 1310m(SWC)-1412m(log) is considered to have accumulated under outer shelf to upper bathyal conditions, with good open marine influences shallowing above 1408m (SWC). Terrigenous input is considered to have been severely reduced, as indicated by the low numbers of miospores and paucity of structural humic plant debris. The sub-interval 1292m(SWC)-1046m(SWC) yields palynofloras broadly comparable to those of the underlying sub-interval, but with increased terrigenous input, and increased input of reworked material. The youngest sub-interval [627m(SWC)-1007m(SWC)] contains palynofloras with significant non-marine component, especially at and above 893m(SWC). The increase in proportion of miospores (spores and pollen) is accompanied by low numbers of freshwater algae. The latter increase in numbers noticeably at the top of the sub-interval.

Several of these forms restrict the age to Turonian or younger, e.g. H. hoelzli, W. baltica and P. lundegreni. The presence of W. baltica and probable specimens (poor preservation) of ELhoelzli at the m, makes it likely that the age is not younger than Coniacian or possibly Santonian at this level. The uppermost sample contained few age diagnostic species, though Robaszynski et al. (1980) suggest Santonian last occurrence for H. delrioensis, which is recorded in this sample (54.91 m). The nannoflora assemblage in this interval yielded several mutually exclusive index species, and its stratigraphic application is not wholly straightforward. The absence of Illiadastauroprhon2 implies that this interval is not later than Coniacian.

The core has been sub-divided into two lithological units, which are interpreted to be lateral developments of the Spekk and Rogn Formations (Figure 3.5.1). The (mainly) Late Kimmeridgian Spekk Formation (>61 m) consists of dark grey shale/claystone, which shows increasing silt/sand content and bioturbation towards the top. Planktic microfossils document nearly normal marine environment, and the unit represents slightly regressive sequence in pelagic domain with poor bottom water circulation, especially in the lower half. The latest Kimmeridgian - earliest Volgian Rogn Formation (>11 m, see also core 6307/07-U-02) consists of more or less massive fine grained sandstone. The unit represents sediment gravity flows in nearly normal marine environment (see discussion in Chapter 4.3.3). The distinct boundary between the two lithological units could not be related to any strong seismic reflector. Strong semi-regional reflectors within the lower unit seem to be related to cemented zones within the shale/claystone. The lower unit (Spekk Formation) posesses good potential for oil and wet gas generation. TOC values vary from to 18%. Hydrogen indices of nearly 800 mg HC/g TOC are observed. The kerogen (type I, II and III) is immature. The upper unit (Rogn Formation) showed high quality reservoir properties, with porosities of more than 30% and permeabilities which cluster at 700 mD.

The formation consists of three beds of fine grained sandstones, ranging in thickness from to in, separated by two thinner beds (30 - 70 cm) of very fine grained clayey sandstones. The fine grained sandstone beds are well sorted and non-graded. Except for a few water escape structures, they are massive. They have sharp both upper and lower boundaries. In the uppermost bed the lower boundary is also erosive. Micro-faults occur in the two uppermost beds. The very fine grained clayey sandstone beds show poorer sorting than the finegrained sandstone beds. They also have larger amount of organic detritus. Primary sedimentary structures are scarce, but horisontal lamination can be seen in the uppermost bed. Petrography/mineralogy and diagenesis The Spekk Formation (80.1 - m) consisting of shale to sandy shale has only been subjected to XRD-analyses (whole rock). Kaolinite, pyrite and mica/illite are the major minerals (Table 3.5.1; Figure 3.5.3). The quartz and potassium feldspar content seem to be related to the grain size, and increases from rather minor amounts in the shale to major constituents in the sandy shale. Kaolinite exhibits the opposite trend. Plagioclase is identified only in one sample (28.25 m), and there are minor amounts of mixed layer clay (illite/smectite) in few samples. The samples at and represent carbonate cemented intervals. Visually there are observed numerous carbonate cemented horizons (Figure 3.5.3). In addition to calcite the only minerals formed during diagenesis are probably pyrite, siderite and dolomite/ankerite. It is assumed that they are formed by shallow diagenetic reactions, completely environmentally controlled, reflecting reducing marine environment. The co-existence of iron containing carbonates and pyrite is caused by complete consumption of sulphide by pyrite precipitation, and generation of methanic environment (Berner, 1981) in which the solubility product of siderite and dolomite/ankerite is reached. This is not an unusal situation under anoxic marine conditions.', 'Passage_id': 321}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6206/2-U-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -122- Bag NTEF-GRUPPUN It is difficult to draw any conclusions regarding burial depth based on the mineralogical data, but the general broad shape of mica/illite peak at 10 (meaning poor crystallinity), indicates shallow burial. This is supported by low vitrinite reflectance measurements. 18.5 - m: Rogn Formation, latest Kimmeridgian - earliest Volgian The Rogn Formation (18.5 - m) mainly consisting of well cemented, fine grained, homogeneous sandstone has been subjected to thin section analyses (ordinary petrographic microscope, SEM) and XRD-analyses (whole rock). Quartz, potassium feldspar, kaolinite, dolomite and pyrite are the main minerals (Table 3.5.1; Figure 3.5.3). Plagioclase in significant amounts is identified only in two of the five analyses. The same is the situation for mixed layer clay (illite/smectite) and mica/illite. The sand grains are subangular, have low sphericity and are well sorted (Figure 3.5.4a). This means textural immature sediment regarding grain shape and textural mature sediment regarding sorting. These characteristics imply relatively short transportation distance, but exposure to sedimentation and transporting mechanisms which resulted in excellent sorting. According to Dott (1964) the sandstones can be classified as arkosic arenites similar to the sandstones in the Rogn The grain contacts are tangential to straight and pressure solution seems to be of minor importance (Figure 3.5.4a). Neither deformation nor reorientation of grains are well demonstrated, so compaction has only had minor effect on the texture. The major mineralogical phases that formed during the chemical diagenesis were quartz, potassium feldspar, pyrite and kaolinite, while dolomite/- ankerite is more locally developed (Figures 3.5.4a-e). Some of the kaolinite is also of clastic origin. Biotite, plagioclase and potassium feldspar appear to be leached (Figures 3.5.4b, 3.5.4f, 3.5.4g). Pyrite is probably precipitated as result of migration of sulphide rich pore water from the underlying sulphur rich shale during compaction. Transformation of mica to kaolinite is observed in all the investigated thin sections.

This is inferred from the low concentration of dry occluded/headspace gas with wetness of below 18%. The methane concentration does not exceed 524 pl gas/kg dry rock and normal butane and heavy hydrocarbons are absent, which is in agreement with the gas wetness results. In common with the analytical data from the sandstone, the results from the occasionally silty shales in the underlying Spekk Formation (80.1 - m) do not suggest the presence of non-indigenous, migrated hydrocarbons. Thermal maturity of organic matter One set of typical biomarker mass chromatograms of one sample (E-214) is shown in Figure 3.5.12. Both sterane and hopane mass chromatograms contain compounds typical of immature samples. High abundance of hopenes and 17B(H), 210(H)-hopanes (m/z 191), and abundant rearranged sterenes (diasterenes, m/z 257) and 14a(H), 17a(H)-steranes (m/z 217) are typical features of low maturity. Most of the biomarker ratios show some variation with depth (Figures 3.5.13 and 3.5.14), but no simple depth dependent correlation is seen. The relative abundance of 17a(H), 210(H)-hopanes (a0/a0+00) varies from 56.7 to 40.9% in the interval from to m. Confident huminite reflectance values vary from to 0.34%, whereas the spore colouration index from microscopy of acid resistant organic matter in transmitted light, is constantly 2-3. Thus, it can be concluded that the organic matter in Spekk Formation is thermally immature.', 'Passage_id': 327}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6206/2-U-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -145- CD ,,EK _INTEF-GRUPPEN transmitted and UV-light were carried out on the same samples as those subjected to PY-GC-MS and GC-MS. The TOC content varies from to wt%, whereas the hydrogen index is between 127 to 692 mg HC/g TOC. The petroleum potential varies from to 57.81 mg HC/g rock (Figure 3.5.16). This suggests considerable variation in source rock richness and kerogen quality from gas-prone, type III kerogens to very organic-rich rocks containing oil-prone, type kerogen. The variation seen in hydrogen index versus TOC profile indicate broad correlation between TOC and hydrogen index. The rich, oil-prone kerogen is present in thin beds of usually no more than thickness, which are particularly frequent below 69 m. The bulk of the rock section in Zone has TOC content of between and wt% and hydrogen index values of between 250 and 350 mg HC/g TOC (Figure 3.5.16). The data suggest mixed, wet gas/condensate-prone type II/III kerogen. The samples selected for the various follow-up analyses are mainly from the very thin source rock beds described above, except for the samples at and m, which have lower hydrogen indices of 256 and 376 mg HC/g TOC (i.e. type II/III kerogen), respectively. The concentrations of hydrocarbons extracted from the six samples selected for follow-up analysis vary from 256 to 495 ppm (Figure 3.5.17). There is fair correlation between the concentration of extracted hydrocarbons and hydrogen indices inferred from the Rock-Eval screening analyses. The variations of the saturate/aromatic ratios show zigzag trend with depth (Figure 3.5.17). In view of the few samples analysed, these variations could be accidental. There is apparently no correlation between the saturate/aromatic ratio and the Rock-Eval hydrogen index. The three kerogens from 70.52, and investigated by transmitted and UV-microscopy contain 80-85% amorphous matter (Figure 3.5.18. low content of black coaly (5-10%), woody (5-10%) and liptinitic resistant organic matter (5%) suggests that the visible terrestrial influence on these rocks is minor.', 'Passage_id': 328}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6206/2-U-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -148 IB _INTEF-GFIUPPEN The similar microscopic composition of the three kerogen samples is at variance with the Rock-Eval data, which show variation in hydrogen index from 495 to 256 mg HC/g TOC. The 813C stable isotope values are more consistent with the hydrogen index data, after the work of Huc et al. (1985) on the Draupne and Heather Formations in the North Sea. The 613C increases from -29.4% to -26.8% (PDB) concomitant with decrease of the hydrogen index from 495 to 256 mg HC/g TOC in zone of core 6307/07-U-03A (Figure 3.5.19). A more detailed investigation of the three kerogens from 70.52, and 60.83 by microscopy in UV-light shows that there is difference between the hydrogen rich type II kerogens at and in and the mixed type III/II kerogen from in. Fresh or brackish-water botryococcoid algae, present in the two type II kerogens at and m, are not observed in the type III/II kerogen from m. relatively high alkadiene/n- decene ratio (Figure 3.5.20) of from Py-GC-MS is observed in the pyrolysates from the type II kerogens. Alkadienes are absent or in such low concentrations as to be undetectable in the pyrolysate from the mixed type III/II kerogen at m. Long-chain alkadienes have been observed in the green, active growth form of the algae Bouyococcusbraunii (Horsfield, 1984). The content of C28 compounds in the C27 - C29 steranes could imply that the proportion of the fresh or brackish water algae is relatively low (Figure 3.5.18). The C28 compounds account for only to 19.2% of the C27 - C29 regular steranes. Thus, as opposed to the alkadienes in the pyrolysate, the steranes indicate no large contribution of freshwater/brackish water algae. So, the noticable alkadiene/n-decene ratios possibly indicate that the fresh or brackish water algal fraction contains mainly the green, active growth form Botryoccocus braunii. However, the total concentration of fresh/brackish water algae is low. The C27 compounds are predominant and slightly in excess of the C29 steranes. The prevalent C27 steranes suggest a mainly marine algal contribution to the organic matter in zone I, in contrast to the variable hydrogen indices. The six n-alkane and five saturate hydrocarbon fractions subjected to capillary gas chromatography (CGC) both show substantial variations. All of the samples analysed, from to in, show predominance of higher molecular weight, waxy n-alkanes between n-C23 and n-C29. Next to the waxy n-alkanes, the often algal/bacteria-derived n-C15, n-C17 and n-C21', 'Passage_id': 329}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6206/2-U-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -155- CD_E zU - NTEF-GRUPPEN indicate that the zone from to is characterized by very organic-rich source rocks which contain mostly oil-prone, type II to mixed type I/II kerogen. Type kerogens are represented sporadically at 52.85, 50.50, 49.50, and-47.50 m. Organic-rich samples with mixed type II/III kerogens occur at 55.26, and in the transition between zones II and III at m. The reduced kerogen qualities of the latter samples are associated with an input of coarser elastic material. The more promising source rocks have extremely low Rock-Eval oxygen indices, typically from to 10 mg/g TOC (Figure 3.5.22), although there is no definite correlation between hydrogen and oxygen index. The boundary between the typical source rocks qualities of the rocks in Zone II and those of the underlying Zone is transitional. The boundary between Zone II and the overlying Zone III, between and m, is characterized by reduction in TOC and hydrogen index from to wt% and from 600 to 86 mg HC/g TOC, respectively (Figure 3.5.16). The sample from has TOC and hydrogen index of wt% and 328 mg HC/g TOC, respectively, that represents intermediate values between Zone II and the overlying Zone III. The boundaries between the three source rock zones do not appear to be related to visible unconformities in the lithological or biostratigraphical record. However, between Zone II and Zone III the boundary appears to coincide with an abrupt upwards change from laminated non-swelling to swelling shales. The samples selected for further analyses have TOC contents of between wt% and wt% and screening hydrogen indices that vary from 371 to 639 mg HC/g TOC. The follow-up samples have been selected to reflect most of the previously observed variations in the organic geochemistry of the rocks in Zone II, as inferred from the screening analysis. The results obtained from these follow-up analyses are broadly similar to those obtained from the organic-rich rocks previously described from zone I, despite the different hydrogen indices. There are some contrasts between apparently similar kerogen types in zones and II, particularly when the samples at and are compared with the zone below. Microscopy of the kerogen from the two samples shows particularly high content of amorphous organic matter (90-95%), of which 40% show bright yellow fluorescence in ultra-violet light, which suggests more hydrogen-rich kerogen type than is described from Zone I. The proportion of amorphous, and especially fluorescent amorphous kerogen increases upwards in zone II,', 'Passage_id': 330}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6206/2-U-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -158- ii (0_ _Eg _INTEF-GRUPPIEN indices of 157 and 300 mg HC/g TOC indicate type III and mixed type III/II kerogens, respectively. The concentration of extractable hydrocarbons in the rock at is poor (94 ppm), whereas the rock at has fair hydrocarbon extractibility of 219 ppm. The saturate/aromatic ratios of 0.5 and for the two samples are similar to those associated with rocks containing mixed type II/III kerogens in zones and III (Figure 3.5.17). In the m/z 217 mass chromatogram of the sample at the C29 compounds account for 50% of the C27  C29 regular steranes. This is higher than in Zones and II (Figure 3.5.18) and would be consistent with humic nature for the kerogend, as inferred from Rock-Eval hydrogen index data. In addition, the gas chromatograms of the saturates show high CPI (Figure 3.5.21) and high concentration of n-C27, n-C25, n-C23, probably derived from higher land plants. The n-alkanes with even carbon chain lengths show a maximum at n-C 26. The marine influence is indicated by the presence of C27 steranes in the m/z 217 chromatogram. relative enrichment of 13C in the kerogen is typical for humic kerogens from the Heather Formation in the North Sea, as opposed to depletion of deuterium observed in the kerogen at m. As in Zone II, the 813C and 6D of the kerogen appear to be inversely related. The main compounds in the saturates at are n-C27, n-C25 and n-C23. This together with the high aromatic/n-alkene ratios of the corresponding pyrolysate (Figure 3.5.20) suggest that the waxy compounds in the extracts are derived predomenantly from higher terrestrial land plants. The presence of well developed n-alkene/n-alkane homologues in the pyrogram (TIC) indicate that this rock, which has hydrogen index of 200 mg HC/g TOC, could have some potential for generation of heavier hydrocarbons. The presence of alkadienes (a typical example shown in Figure 3.5.23) reveal possibly the influence from the active growing stage of Botryoccocus Brauni (Figure 3.5.20, Horsfield, 1984). In summary, organic-rich rocks with potential for wet gas/condensate, and possibly oil, are present in Zone III. The follow-up analyses suggest major influence from higher land plant material, but with some contribution from marine organic matter and to lesser extent brackish/ freshwater algae.', 'Passage_id': 331}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6206/2-U-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: - 161- - ROGN Fm.

At the site this boundary was found at 93 ms, corresponding to below the seabed. Both units have an irregular seismic signature, with several apparentlyprograding reflections. The discontinuity of reflections can partly be explained by several small, easterly dipping faults. The strong reflector between the middle and upper units at 34 ms corresponding to in the corehole was interpreted as the Late Kimmerian unconformity. Truncations as well as onlaps are observed at this sequence boundary. Faults have caused small displacements resulting in characteristic stepped character of the reflector. The upper unit has transparent seismic signature with some few low amplitude reflections, which are partly continuous.

In about half of the samples there are plagioclase, ankerite/dolomite and pyrite, and in few samples there are traces of siderite, gypsum, mixed layer clay (illite/smectite) and smectite. The potassium feldspar is always dominating over plagioclase. The mineralogy varies with grain size, which is reflected by the two shale samples at and m, that have much more kaolinite and less quartz than the other samples. The mineral grains are subangular, have high sphericity and are well sorted (Figures 3.6.4a, 3.6.4b and 3.6.4f). This implies relatively short distance of transport, but exposure to effective sorting mechanisms. According to Dott (1964) the sandstones can be classified as arkosic arenites/wackes depending on the clay matrix content. The grain contacts are mainly tangential to straight, and pressure solution is of minor importance. Neither deformation nor re-orientation of grains are well demonstrated, and compaction thus seems to have been insignificant. Early calcite cementation also seems to be unimportant. Thus we conclude that it is unlikely that this sediment experienced burial depths of any significance. This is also concluded from the organic geochemical data. The possibility of low effective grain stress due to pore water overpressure, caused by early shale capping, should, however, not be completely iguared. The major mineralogical phases formed during chemical diagenesis are quartz, potassium feldspar and kaolinite, while dolomite/ankerite are locally developed (Figures 3.6.4b, 3.6.4c, 3.6.4d, 3.6.4e). Much of the kaolinite is also of elastic origin (Figure 3.6.4f). The main leached mineral phases are plagioclase and potassium feldspar, but also some leached mica is seen (Figures 3.6.4a, 3.6.4b, 3.6.4f, 3.6.4g). Authigenic quartz growth is common, and is partly syndiagenetic with kaolinitization of the feldspars. The quartz overgrowth has also continued after formation of kaolinite as it partly encloses kaolinite crystals (Figures 3.6.4e and 3.6.4e).

These zones are identified by peaks in all the logs except for the neutron log. Cemented zones in the massive sands are identified by peaks in sonic, density and neutron and drop in gamma. The relative high gamma in the Rogn Formation is caused by high K-feldspar and mica contents. Variations in gamma in the sand above 121 is due to local variations in K-feldspar and mica contents.

The trend and the peaks of the sound velocity calculated from sonic log correlate well with the lab measured horizontal sound velocity. The difference in the levels is mainly due to velocity anisotropy in the rocks, to stress release in the cores and to different measurement tools. This will be discussed further in Appendix A.6.

The chronostratigraphic boundaries are all based on palynology supported by the other groups at different levels and intervals. Numerous bivalves from 77.31 and upwards are not yet reported on by the specialist involved. The core seems to represent more or less continuous succession from latest Kimmeridgian to Early Valanginian. At the seismic sequence boundary (corresponding to the level in the core) thought to represent the late Kimmerian unconformity, there is hardly detected any hiatus. 190.1 - m: Spekk Formation, latest Kimmeridgian - earliest Volgian Palynology Perisselasphaeridiumparmosum is present in the claystone in the lowermost part of the core (Figures 3.6.9 and 3.6.10) and according to Piasecki (1980) points to Late Kimmeridgian age in East Greenland sections whereas Riding (1987) recorded it four ammonite zones higher in Lincolnshire (see Chapter 3.5.5). The reported range from East Greenland may be the most relevant for our area.

The aspect of the fine debris in these samples makes it probable that this result is valid for the entire formation. Radiolarians Siliceous microfossils in the form of radiolaria and sponges occur in varying frequencies within the interval 97.02-36.03 m. With few exceptions, the opal skeletons have been replaced by another silica phase and pyritization is common. Consequently, the original morphology of many of the specimens is only partially discernible, but it is obvious that the fauna undergoes numerous sequential overturns throughout the interval.

Other important elements are: ?Pleclina sp., Trochamminasquamatalonnis, Haplophragmiumaequale, A.reophacoides and GthwhyMa cf. gerkei, all of which have last occurrences in sample in. This fauna assemblage is also characterized by significant amount of calcareous foraminifera, although only pyritized specimens of Lenticullm, Globulina and Dentalina are recorded in sample m. First occurrences of L.nodosa, L. sossipatrovae and G. prisca are noted in sample in. The uppermost assemblage is recorded in three samples, with upward increasing diversity. The agglutinated element plays only minor part, and a number of first occurrences are noted for the calcareous species: Guttullna anhaerens, L. cf. audax and Saracenaria spp. (sample m) , Ramulina aculeata and L. sternalis (sample m), D. legumen, D. linearis, D. filiforrnis, L. muensteri, Pyrulina spp. Lingulina sp. and Lagena hauteriviana (sample m). This assemblage continues into the overlying red claystone. It is problematic to draw definite conclusions with respect to age on these assemblages, because the distribution of most of the species are strongly facies dependant. Nevertheless it is suggested here that the microfossil record support the conclusions based on palynology. Many authors have reported similar shift in assemblages during late Berriasian (Ryazanian), e.g. Lofaldli & Thusu (1979), Lofaldli & Nagy (1983), Bartenstein & Bettenstaedt (1962), Fletcher (1973) and Hart et al. (1981). The microfaunal assemblage in the red claystone (24.6-13.6 m) represents continuation of the uppermost assemblage of the underlying grey claystone. The assemblage is dominated by Demallnaspp., Lenticulinaspp. and Polymorphinidae. In addition to some new species, this fauna differs from that of the underlying grey claystone in the general increase in diversity (though the richness varies considerably) and the change from white to red stained specimens. The significant amounts of bivalve and echinodermal debris and ostracods is also noteworthy.

From microfaunal point of view it is difficult to define the lower boundary of the Valanginian epoch. At the level we feel confident about Valanginian age assignment on the occurrences of L.kumWak: and A. cellensis. The former is reported to have first occurrence in Late Valanginian in Poland (Sztejn, 1957), and the latter in Middle Valanginian in Germany (Bartenstein & Bettenstaedt, 1962) and England (Hart et al., 1981). The significance of the occurrence of P.subcrekuw at the level is uncertain. The occurrences of S. minima and L.saxonica in the in sample indicate Valanginian age also at this level. The former is reported to have first occurrence in Late Valanginian in Poland (Sztejn, 1957), and the latter in Late Valanginian in Germany (Bartenstein & Bet tenstaedt, 1962) and England (Hart et al., 1981). C. pseudostriatula, which was recognized at the level is known to straddle the Berriasian- Valanginian boundary both in Poland, Germany and England. Thus the microfaunal records support Valanginian dating at least down to the level, at the first recorded income of S. minima and L.scuonica. The calcareous nannofossil association is basically the same for the entire Lange Formation and there is no positive evidence for an earlier age than Early Valanginian. Ellipsagelosphaera fossacincta is relatively more common at 26.82 in, whereas the species variability is clearly less than in the overlying samples. This might give evidence of shallower or more nearshore environment than above. Below m, the samples are barren for calcareous nannofossils. A rich assemblage of calcareous nannofossils is met in the upper (red) clays tone. Micrantholithus speetonensis, Micrantholithus brevis and Rucinolithus sp.

In Figure 2, the fission track age and mean track length of each sample are plotted as function of depth and present temperature, (with errors plotted at  2a). The variation of stratigraphic age with depth is also shown as the solid line in the central panel. Fission track ages were calculated using the standard fission track age equation (Hurford and Green, 1982) and errors are quoted at the level of one standard deviation throughout. All constants used in derivation of the results are shown at the bottom of Table using the nomenclature of Hurford and Green (1982). The Zeta calibration factor has been determined empirically (Green, 1985) by direct comparison with K-Ar ages for set of carefully chosen age standards, following the methods outlined by Hurford and Green (1983). The pooled or maximum probability age is determined from the ratio of the total spontaneous and induced track counts in all the analysed grains. Errors for the pooled age were calculated using the 'conventional' technique outlined by Green (1981), based on the total number of tracks counted for each track density measurement. The variability of fission track ages between individual apatite grains within each sample can be assessed using chi-squared (2) statistic (Galbraith, 1981), the results of which are summarised for each sample in Table 3. The probability of obtaining the observed x2 value, for v degrees of freedom (where = number of crystals -1), which can be obtained from standard tables, indicates the probability that all the grains counted belong to single age population. probability of less than 5% denotes significant spread of single grain ages, and suggests that real differences exist between the fission track ages of individual apatite grains. significant spread in grain ages can result either from inheritance of detrital grains from mixed source areas, or from differential annealing in apatite grains of different composition, within narrow range of temperature (see Appendix D). Calculation of the pooled age inherently assumes that only single population of ages is present, and is thus not appropriate to samples containing significant spread of fission track ages. In such cases the mean of the single grain fission track ages provides useful measure and this parameter has been used for those samples in which P(x2)<5%.

Note that if temperature increases again, subsequent to the initial cooling, those tracks formed during this second heating phase will undergo greater shortening. If the temperature in the second heating phase reaches similar values to that reached in the original heating, the two generations of tracks will be identical and all information on the original heating phase will be lost. If the temperature during the second heating phase increases beyond that reached in the original heating phase, p1j tracks are shortened further. Our understanding of the behaviour of the AFTA system during geological thermal histories is based on study of the response of fission tracks to elevated temperatures in the laboratory (Green et al., 1986; Laslett et al., 1987; Duddy et al., 1988; Green et al., 1989b) and in geological situations (Green et al., 1989a), observations of the lengths of spontaneous tracks in apatites from wide variety of geological environments (Gleadow et al., 1986), and the relationship between track length reduction and reduction in fission track age observed in controlled laboratory experiments (Green, 1988). Final interpretation is based on computer modelling of track shortening through likely thermal histories for an apatite of average composition (Green et al., 1989b). As explained by Green et al. (1989b), the uncertainty in estimates of maximum paleotemperature derived using this approach is thought to be 10C. Predictions from these modelling procedures agree well with observed AFTA parameters in apatites of the appropriate composition in samples from the Otway Basin reference wells (Gleadow and Duddy, 1981; Gleadow et al., 1983; Green et al., 1989a), providing support for the validity of extrapolation from laboratory to geological timescales. The ratio of chlorine to fluorine in the apatite lattice exerts compositional control on the degree of annealing, with apatites richer in fluorine being more easily annealed than those richer in chlorine. Our understanding of the kinetics of fission track annealing relates to apatite with Cl/Cl+F of 0.1 (Durango apatite) on which most of our original experimental studies were _ carried out. Unpublished laboratory annealing studies on range of different apatites, together with observations of annealing in apatites from the Otway Basin reference wells, which show  wide spread of compositions, afford means of extending the model predictions to apatites of other compositions. Since the apatite grains analysed in this study are likely to have been originally derived predominantly from basement rocks, restricted compositional range would be expected in all samples, with C1/(Cl+F) varying from zero (pure fluorapatite) to around 0.1, the value in Durango apatite. Therefore, in the following discussion, paleotemperature estimates are based on this assumption.

Generally the Rxo-Pickett plots give lower m-values than the Rt- Pickett plot due to the hydrocarboneffect on the Rt log. Comparing the different Pickett-plots with the porosity log plots a reasonable estimate for the cementation exponent (m) is 2.10. In the Tor-formation the Rxo-Pickett plots also show lower m- values than the Rt-Pickett plot. The Rxo-plots indicate cemen- tation exponent of 2.00. The lower in the Tor formation is also expected from the poro- sity - permeability relationship indicating the Tor formation rocks generally to have lower turtosity than the Ekofisk for- mation. 8.

Porosity reducing program logics like the sonic porosity limit, the maximum porosity limit and the +D logic Are quite often operating despite that the hole conditions and log quality are go.od_. The porosity reducing logics should only be used when there exists reason not to trust the FDC or CNL logs like hole wash outs, adjacent bed effect, or when the clay content is very high and the formations are impermeable. Under such circumstances the standard porosity logic is not always valid.

A log break defines the upper limit of this interval. The age is defined upon the following micropalaeontological, nannofloral and palynological criteria: - the occurrence of Pseudotextularia elegans, Rugoglobigerina/ Archaeoglobigeripa complex, Heterohelix pulchra, Heterohelix globulosa and Biglobigerinella multispina at 1829.50th (SWC). - the appearance of Nephrolithus frequens (abundant), Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis (common), Prediscosphaera spl), Lithraphidites quadratus and Micula staurophora at 1829.50m(SWC). - the presence of Globotruncana contuse and Hrizalina incrassata at 1830m. - the appearance, at 1838.00m (SWC), of numerous specimens of Cyclonephelium distinctum, abundant specimens of Areoligera sp.4 and Alterbia acuminata. - the subsequent appearance of Palynodinium grallator and Hystrichosphaeropsis sp. at 1840m. - the occurrence of Globotruncanella havanensis, Rugoglobigerina cumulate and Abathomphalus mayaroensis at 1840m.

The occurrence of Cretaceous restricted species including Pseudotextularia elegans, Rugoglobigerina/Archaeoglobige.rina complex, Heterohelix pulchra, Heterohelix globulosa and Biglobigerinella multispina at 1829.50m (SWC) indicates that sediments of this age have been penetrated.

The latest Maastrichtian, Pseudotextularia spp. Assemblage is developed throughout this interval, based on the presence of Pseudotextularia elegans 1829.50m (SWC) and Globotruncana contusa (1830m). The other nominate taxon of this assemblage, Racemiguembelina fructicosa was first recorded (presumably as cavings) at the base of the interval at 1850m. In general, planktonic foraminifera appear in significant quantities in this interval and dominate the associations with agglutinated and calcareous benthonic foraminifera being subordinate. The sidewall cores and ditch cuttings samples examined from this interval yielded moderate to well preserved nannofloral assemblages. The appearance of Nephrolithus frequens (abundant) in association with Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis (common), Prediscosphaera sp.1, Lithraphidites quadratus and Micula staurophora at 1829.50m (SWC) indicates that sediments of latest Maastrichtian age have been penetrated at this depth. The occurrence of Nephrolithus sp. (Wind, 1979) also at 1829.50m may be of future biostratigraphic and correlative use. The subsequent appearance of Arkhangelskiella costata, Cribrosphaera daniae, Arkhangelskiella specillata, Gartnerago costatum and Cretarhabdus decorus at 1830.00m provides further general support to the age assigned to the interval.

However, distinct nannofloral change occurs at 2330m, with the appearance of richer nannofloral assemblage compared to those noted in the overlying early Campanian interval. The appearance of common Watznaueria barnesae in association with Helicolithus traheculatus at 2330m, provides the first positive nannofloral evidence for the Santonian age assigned to this interval based on micropalaeontological criteria. PALYNOLOGY Dinocyst dominated palynofloras were recovered from this interval, with general downhole decrease in numbers and diversity of palynomorphs. The basal sample at 2326m is characterised by an abundance of unstructured inertinite grains. Dominant components are the Spiniferites ramosus group, Chatangiella spp., C. granulifera and Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum. No positive palynological evidence for the penetration of Santonian deposits is encountered, although the appearances of Surculosphaeridium longifurcatum and Chatangiella ditissima at 2295.00m (SWC) may be of local correlative value. Rare, recycled miospores are observed at 2295.00m (SWC), specimen of Limbosporites lunbladii indicates reworking of Upper Triassic deposits, whilst Callialasporites spp., at 2306m reflects derivation from Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous deposits. 44 ' Ramp!!\", 'Passage_id': 364}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/7-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: VIII SELECTED REFERENCES ANDERTON, R., BRIDGES, P.R., LEEDER, M.R. and SELLWOOD, B.W., 1979. dynamic stratigraphy of the British Isles; study in crustal evolution.

The MSD reults from the individual runs of dipmeter tools in this well were spliced together to form single continuous file. Where the logged intervals overlapped, data from the smaller hole section was used. This file was loaded onto the the Dipmeter Advisor workstation and structural analysis performed. This is an artificial intelligence program designed to look initially for short groups of adjacent tadpoles with the same dip and azimuth. These groups are called green patterns from the classical dipmeter red, green and blue pattern interpretation system. The pro- gram then tries to join the green patterns together, within certain limitations of distance apart and solid angle variations. New patterns formed are called mega-greens, and these can similarly be joined together to form structural dip. Over large interval the pro- gram may also propose number of different structural dip zones representing different structural events. The intention with this study was to perform progressive structural dip removal in order to identify all the different structural events. Since the uppermost event affects all those below, this must be identified first and removed. The structural analysis can then be repeated on the new data to identify the second most recent structural event, and this process is then repeated until all structural dip effects have been removed from the entire interval.

The results of this first automatic pass are shown in Table 1, where seperate struc- tural dip zones were identified. The first question was whether the uppermost zone was true structural dip zone as it was much shorter than the others. After manually reviewing the dip data and generating some azimuth histograms over this zone, dip of 10 to 090 was determined as being the uppermost structural dip - ie. the most recent structural event. After the automatic structural analysis was repeated only zones were found, and', 'Passage_id': 367}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7228/2-1 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: these are presented in Table 2. 1 2 213 1 9 303 1 11 315 2 12 334 3 15 324 3 16 316 3 17o 304 4 19 264 Table 2. This shows that structural dip has been effectively removed down to 1274m. Below this there seems to be series of continuously increasing dip zones, from 9 up to 17, all with generally NW dip direction. This could be result of rollover into NE-SW striking growth fault or related to salt movements - or perhaps combination of both. Although this is probably one structural event between 5m, there are dearly number of smaller events within. Rather than try to perform some kind of average dip removal for the entire interval, or go the other way and perform dip removal for every minor event, an intermediate approach has been taken. The zones 0m and 1880 - 2774m have very similar dips, and after manual checking of the dips data an average structural dip of 10 to 310 was selected. After this was removed from 1274m down to TD, and new structural analysis performed, the zones in Table 3. were found. 1 1 199 1 1 022 2 in 5 033 3 5 349 3 in 5 324 3 4 313 4 111 14 235 Table 3. The upper two zones show that the structural dip has been very effectively removed down to 2774m. The next zone, from 4m, posed problem as there was 45 azimuthal variation from the zones below. However, when the dip data was studied manu- ally, this structural dip did not appear to be valid and the zone actually appeared similar to the zone below. As result, structural dip of 5 to 350 was removed from 2774m to TD.

This shows that the structural dip was effectively removed from 2774m down to 3722m. Although most of the effects of structural dip were removed down to 4031m it was decided to remove the 3 to 220 for completeness. Structural analysis after this (Table 5) shows that this was not totally effective, and may not have been necessary. The final structural zone of 14 to 219 also does not bear too much manual scrutiny, and although there is wide spread of clips they are mostly related to sedimentological variations with, some slight affects of 3 structural dip. This is suggested by the patterns which generally decrease to around 3.

PALAEOCURRENT DIRECTIONS The interpretation of palaeocurrents in this well is complicated by the lack of units which could be expected to contain features resulting from traction currents, and by the complex structural history. The final plot in Enclosures and shows variety of possible dip directions. The most reliable trends are below 4000m and here there is strong indication of currents from the North East or occasionally from East. The results of this progressive structural dip removal do not give much support on large scale to currents from other directions, although local variations can be found. It is felt beyond the scope of this report and the background information which was available to comment with any more certainty than this. each interpreter should consider the results of the structural dip removal in the light of their own sedimentological expertise in the region and their own ideas of the structural development of this area.', 'Passage_id': 369}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7228/2-1 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 4. CONCLUSIONS  This interval has undergone complex structural history, partly with continuous progressive movement.  An attempt has been made to identify the depth of the main structural events and perform progressive structural dip removal.  As result of this there is an overall indication of palaeocurrent directions from the North-West, although local variations could be interpreted.  bed boundaried picked from the FMS generally confirm the MSD results. The greater dip variation from the FMS results from the non-planarity between the top and bottom surfaces of some bedding units, and highlights the greater interpretation confidence possible from FMS images.  Faults and fractures interpreted from the FMS images agree with the core fractures and suggest 3.25m core to log shift is required.  The section around 4200m could be interpreted as series of imbricate faults and related fractures with North-South strike and downthrow to the East or East South-East. Fault dip magnitude would be around 40.', 'Passage_id': 370}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7228/2-1 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Prior to the introduction of the Formation MicroScanner (FMS) tool in 1985, interpretation of geological features within the wellbore involved analysis of indirect geophysical measurements such as curves or dip results. The Borehole Televiewer (BHTV) had been developed as an imaging device in the 1960's (Zemanek et al, 1969), but images could not provide sufficient resolution for detailed analysis of sedimentary features or healed fracture systems. With the FMS came revolution in geological interpretation from wireline log data: detailed geological features on the borehole wall could now be seen as microresistivity images. The purpose of this paper is to describe the FMS tool development, acquisition technology and operational recommendations, and image processing and display techniques. 2. TOOL HISTORY The FMS tool is the latest development of microresistivity logging, using focused resistivity measurements to yield more detailed information about the formation being loggecL The tool began with the idea of super-dipmeter, development of the two-button Stratigraphic High Resolution Dipmeter Tool (SHDT), and it was envisaged that fractures could be identified by correlation of pairs of microresistivity electrodes within an array. Initially, this array was circular, but this was later changed to linear array which could cover the same area with fewer electrodes. The most critical evolutionary step in the history of the tool was the realisation that the electrodes could be used to generate microresistivity images of the borehole wall, thus enabling identification of fractures and bedding features. The initial prototype one-pad, 40-button tool (Ekstrom et al, 1986) was tested in various parts of the world, including the Southern North Sea in 1984-85 (Frisinger and Gyllensten, 1986, Plumb and Luthi, 1986, Luthi and Banavar, 1988), and was variously named the Micro Scanning Tool (MST) and Formation Imaging Dipmeter Tool (HUT). The two-pad, 54-button (i.e. 27-buttons per pad) Micro-Electrical Scanning Tool (MEST) was field tested in Northern Europe in 1985 (Lloyd al, 1986), and was introduced commercially into the U.K. in 1986 as the Formation MicroScanner (FMS) tool. This was the standard FMS tool used in the North Sea until 1988, when the four-pad, 64-button (i.e. 16 electrodes per pad) FMS tool was introduced (Biischer, 1989). As both the 2-pad and 4-pad tools have been used iti the U.K. recently, both tool designs and processing will be discussed herein. The basic principle of the FMS tool is to map the conductivity of the borehole wall with dense array of sensors.  The tool itself is similar to an SHDT tool, in that the lower section of the tool emits current (the EMEX current) into the formation, which returns to the metal housing of the tool above an insulating sleeve. small proportion of the current, flowing from the button array, is recorded as series of individual microresistivity curves sampled at vertirglly. The rest of the current serves to focus this electrode current giving measurement which has shallow depth of investigation and a very good-vertical resolution. The level of EMEX current is dynamically controlled to optimise tool performance in formations of different or varying resistivities. An inclinometry section, within the insulating sleeve, consists of both triaxial accelerometer and magnetometers which enable speed corrections to be made and the tool orientation to be determined.\", 'Passage_id': 371}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7228/2-1 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: FMS data processing involves both image generation and dip calculation, however differences exist between the 2-pad and 4-pad tools. 4.1. Dip calculation Dip calculation is similar to that from the SHDT tool. With the 2-pad FMS tool, the curves acquired from the eight SHDT electrodes are processed to produce MSD, LOCDIP, CSB and 4-SBS results (Adams, 1987). With the 4-pad FMS tool eight of the microresistivity curves from the arrays are chosen (with the same spacing as the SHDT electrodes) and the SHDT processing is run on these curves. Results are identical (Bilscher, 1989). In addition to the standard SHDT dip processing, new experimental dip processing technique similar to LOCDIP is currently in testing. This technique, called FMSDIP (Antoine, 1988), first traces conductivity contours or flowlines on each image, extracting the major conductivity changes which correspond to bed boundaries. These flowline traces are then matched between pads around the borehole, and the corresponding dip is computed. This technique only applies to 4-pad FMS data. Initial results from this FMSDIP technique are encouraging for the production of automatic dips from FMS images in well-bedded sequences. 4.2. Image processing The objective of image processing of FMS data is to convert the individual curves into images which represent formation conductivity changes as grey-scale or colour images. Image processing is carried out in three main stages: 1. Data restoration During this stage, the acquired data is corrected for variations in tool velocity during logging, the different electrical characteristics of the individual FMS electrodes, and the variation in EMEX current during logging, all of which will prevent the curves from representing true formation changes. number of distinct restoration operations are made: Button row correction and speed correction: As the FMS electrode array consists of two (4-pad) or four (2-pad) rows of buttons, an image generated from the uncorrected curves will display saw-toothed image, as each row passes resistivity change at different time. The button rows can be shifted vertically with respect to each other to correct for this nominal difference but sometimes saw-toothing remains when the tool speed differs from the cable speed. Speed correction therefore needs to be carried out to further comet the data. This may be achieved either by accelerometer-based correction (Kalman Filtering) or by matching the FMS electrodes in separate rows in similar manner to the speed button on the SBDT tool (Adams, 1987). Usually the Kalman Filtering correction is run in combination with the nominal shift correction, followed by the residual button row correction, however this residual correction can only be carried out on the four-row 2-pad FMS tool. Offset and gain equalisation: It is not possible to manufacture FMS electrodes with exactly the same electrical characteristics, and resultant curves will have different dynamic ranges. This is corrected by applying an offset and gain equalisation, therefore equalising the statistics (mean and variance) of the data recorded by each sensor. The effects of equalisation can also be seen by comparing figures 7a and 7b.', 'Passage_id': 372}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7228/2-1 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: EMEX correction: The voltage emanating from the sonde (the EMEX voltage) is automatically adapted during logging to keep the current intensity within certain range, thus maximising curve character. When the tool is against resistive unit, the voltage is increased, thus allowing significant amount of current to enter the formation. Conversely, when the tool is against conductive formation, the voltage is decreased, thus lowering the current intensity and preventing electronic saturation. As result raw FMS image does not represent true variations in formation resistivity. The EMEX correction applied during FMS processing corrects for this variation, and allows large-scale resistivity variations to be examined.  Dead button correction: In some cases, one or two FMS buttons on pad may show flat responses. This dead button response may be corrected by direct interpolation between the neighbouring buttons without significant loss of data resolution. 2. Image generation and display The basic principle of FMS image generation is to map the FMS corrected curve traces into grey-level or colour-scale log. With most imaging devices, limited number of shades are possible, related to the usual 4.x pixel size. The FMS resistivity information from each trace is split into seventeen bands (if grey-scaling is used), and composite image is built up from each of the array traces. Because of the greater sensitivity of the human eye to colour changes, larger number of shades are possible with colour graphics, whether on' paper plots or on the FMS Image Examiner workstation (Boyeldieu and Jeffreys, 1988). FMS data may be displayed in either curve (wiggle trace) or image modes, both allowing different perception of the data. In addition, the images may be displayed azimuthally orientated or unorientated). The unorientated or straight plots are used at small scale (e.g. 1:200) so that image character is not affected by rotation. The azimuthally orientated images (commonly referred to as BORMAP plots) are akin to an unwrapped representation of the borehole wall, and allow the visualisation of features with respect to orientation, the merging of several passes, and the plotting of dip data as sine curves directly on the images. Orientated images are normally used at large scale (e.g. 1:10, 1:5). Using the FMS Image Examiner workstation, the images can also be displayed as a.3-dimensional cylinder, representing view from outside the wellbore. This is useful for visualising complex structures or when the well is highly deviated. 3. Contrast enhancement It is difficult with limited colour-scale image to display all the scales of variation present in the image. For example, it is not possible to show variation related to major lithology change from anhydrite into water-bearing sandstone and at the same time show detailed variation in formation character within each of these units. Therefore contrast enhancement is both necessary and possible with FMS images, and number of different techniques are available.  Static normalisation: This technique determines the grey-scale class limits from mean and variance of data computed using resistivity histogram of the entire processed interval. In essence, the resistivity grey scale is normalised over the entire processed interval, with the effect that identical grey shades anywhere on the plot represent the same resistivity levels, and therefore gross variations of resistivity are shown. Dynamic normalisation: In this case the grey-scale class limits are determined using the mean and variance of histogram of short (2-3ft) sliding window_ The class limits are assigned to the central line of each window before the window moves up one sample and\", 'Passage_id': 373}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7228/2-1 S \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: repeats the process. In this case the resultant grey shades can only be compared over short distances, and no comparison can be made between resistivity changes over an interval larger than one window-length. It is therefore important to use this data in conjunction with statically normalised reference plot. The advantage of dynamic normalisation is the enhancement of small-scale features not picked up by the static normalisation process.  Dynamic histogram normalisation (BILI1E): This enhancement uses the full histogram of the resistivity data within sliding window to drive the grey-scale class limits instead of just mean and variance. The goal is to use the entire grey-scale within one window-length, with approximately the same number or points in each grey class. As consequence, small details are made visible in the resulting plot, but care is required as noise may also be enhanced. Interactive enhancement: Using the FMS Image Examiner workstation (Boyeldieu and Jeffreys, 1988), section of FMS image may be enhanced interactively on the screen to highlight or suppress detail. It is important to be aware when enhancing FMS images that in some short zones such as carbonate concretions, the resistivity contrast between the concretion and the surrounding rock is so high that the EMEX voltage did not have time to respond and the tool could not acquire sufficient detail. No amount of enhancement can retrieve this detail. S. SUMMARY 1. The FMS tool provides detailed microresistivity images of the borehole wall. 2. Two versions of the tool have been in common use, the 2-pad tool (27 electrodes par pad), superceded in 1989 by the 4-pad tool (16 electrodes per pad). The advantages of the 4-pad tool are: i) Only one logging pass required. ii) Good borehole coverage (e.g. gives 40% borehole coverage in an hole with one pass). No depth-matching required. iv) The larger electrode diameter gives better response, especially in zones affected by mudcake or poor hole conditions. 3. FMS logs can be processed to produce both dip results and images. Dip processing produces the standard SHDT MSD, LOCDIP, CSB and 4-SBS results, plus unique flow-line based dip from images (FivISDIP). Before production of images, data is first corrected for velocity variations and variations of EMEX current, and equalised to compensate for different electrical characteristics of the electrodes. Images may be displayed as grey-scale or colour images, orientated, unorientated, or as 3-dimensional cylinder plot. Images can also be enhanced to highlight or suppress features, either by standard processing or using an interactive workstation.', 'Passage_id': 374}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/6-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 1 INTRODUCTION: Twenty-six core samples from the Belladonna (6506/6-1) well, Norwegian Sea, were submitted for fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry. The particular goals of the study were to 1. Evaluate petroleum inclusion presence API gravities and bubble/dew points 2. Evaluate aqueous inclusion homogenization temperatures and salinities. Samples were studied in both plane light and under UV illumination. Fluid inclusion assemblages were identified according to their presence, relationship to the host, consistency of visual parameters and applicability for determining the requested information. From this initial screening, fluid inclusion populations in of the 26 samples were selected for detailed analysis. These included samples from the following depths: 5216.55m 5240.0m 5270.0m Fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures and salinities were determined with Fluid Inc. -modified U.S.G.S. heating-freezing stage using standard techniques. Photomicrographs of representative inclusions are presented herein. All microthermometric data are presented in Tables 1-3. 2.1 Petroleum Inclusions No liquid or gaseous petroleum inclusions are identified within the three samples evaluated during this study. This is in spite of the reported presence of charge within zones represented by samples 5240.0m and 5270.0m. Several occurrences of what initially appeared to be coex- isting non-fluorescent gas and aqueous inclusions were identified in sample 5240.0m. The gas inclusions failed to respond to microthermometry (e.g., did not condense out liquid or vapor phase even upon cooling to -196C); hence, they may represent breached aqueous inclusions rather than low-density petroleum inclusions. 2.2 Aqueous Inclusions Aqueous inclusions are present in these samples within sealed fractures in quartz overgrowths (secondary inclusions) and along quartz dust rims (potentially primary, secondary, or mixed origin). Aqueous inclusions are documented within carbonate cement in sample 5216.55m (pri- mary, secondary or mixed origin) and in barite cement in sample 5240m (primary, secondary or mixed origin).

This trend is not, however, seen in all three samples, as outlined below. There is slight positive correlation between Th and salinity in this sample. 2.2.2 5240.0m: Th(quartz) = 160-175C Salinity(quartz) = 3.1-5.0 wt% (slightly bimodal at 3.1-3.7 wt% and All quartz data is from fractured overgrowths in this sample. Barite may predate quartz overgrowths. There is slight inverse correlation between Th and salinity in this sample. 2.2.3 5270.0m: Th(quartz) = 155-170C Salinity(quartz) = 1.4-10.2 wt% (broadly bimodal at 1.4-4.2 wt% and 9.0-10.2 wt% The low salinity mode is predominantly from fractured overgrowth hosted inclusions, while the high salinity mode is mostly from dust-rim hosted inclusions. This trend is opposite that noted in the shallowest sample. There is no clear-cut relationship between Th and salinity in this sample. The homogenization temperature data are interpreted to record quartz cementation and fracturing of overgrowths over at least the temperature range 155-175C. Quartz cementa- tion may have occurred at lower temperatures as well, because texturally early inclusions are dust-rim hosted, and these are notoriously prone to re-equilibration relative to those inclu- sions hosted by the overgrowth proper or within healed microfractures in quartz overgrowths. This is because the interface between the detrital grain and the overgrowth is itself zone of weakness, with tendency to rupture repeatedly during continued compaction, and to main- tain some communication with the pore fluid via network of microporosity. Consequently, homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions along quartz dust rims are commonly higher than overgrowth and fracture hosted inclusions, and often have been correlated with maximum burial temperatures. However, in these samples dust rim inclusions seem to have temperatures similar to fracture-hosted inclusions. Measured Th is generally minimum estimate of trapping temperature, unless the aqueous fluid is trapped precisely along its saturation curve. The magnitude of the correction neces- sary to convert Th to trapping temperature is dependent on the extent of undersaturation. Corrections are potentially greater at higher temperatures and greater burial depths (higher pore pressures). Empirically, aqueous inclusions that are co-entrapped with petroleum inclu- sions tend to give better trapping temperature estimates, because of the increased likelihood of dissolved gas within the aqueous phase (bringing this phase closer to saturation). No identi- fiable petroleum inclusions are noted in these samples, although some gas-like inclusions were initially identified that behaved unremarkably during microthermometric evaluation. Given the high, raw, measured Th and the burial depth, it is likely that Th values are fairly close Fluid Inclusion Petrography and Microthermometry of: Fit__MT010007 (UW/#    )', 'Passage_id': 376}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/6-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: to maximum burial temperatures in these samples, in spite of lack of independent inclusion evidence to support this interpretation.

The designation of Turonian - Coniacian age is based on the fact that this section is overlain by beds of known Coniacian age and is succeeded down-section by dateable Turonian beds. _ Radiolaria, in limited numbers, appear persistently over this interval.

INTERVAL 10740' - 10880'; Turonian, Upper Cretaceous Massive chalk beds continue as the primary lithology over this interval. There is, however, stronger tendancy for grey chalk to develop. At the top of the section samples are composed entirely of white chalk. At 10780', however, minor percentage of the chalk is faintly greyish white; and at 10820' - 10840' light to mid-grey chalk is present. At the base of the interval the sample at 10880' consists of equal amounts of white chalk and light grey, shaly chalk. A little grey limestone is noted at 10820', and traces of grey-brown dolomite are more frequent within the lower part of the interval. The occurrence of single specimen of Praeglobotruncana stephani at 10740' is taken to indicate that at this level beds are of Turonian age. At 10800' more substantial microfaunal assemblages are present and over the succeeding part of this interval the Turonian age is confirmed by the presence of an assemblage which contains ?Praeglobotruncana aff. stephani, Hedbergella cf. delrioensis H. brittonensis, H. aff. planispira and  Globigerinelloides spp..

The presence, below 10800', of enlarged faunas of planktonic foraminifera suggests return to well developed open marine connections, which in turn is possibly indicative of general deepening of the seas at this locality during Turonian times. INTERVAL 10900' - 10960'; Cenomanian, Upper Cretaceous The section continues over this interval as mixture of chalk and limestone beds. Hard, grey limestone; grey, shaly chalk; and white chalk appear in equal proportions at 10900' - 10920'. This is followed by further beds of solid, white chalk. Traces of crystalline calcite, grey-brown dolomite and pyrite are frequently present.

The highly diverse dinocyst association is numerically dominated by Trithyrodinium suspectum and Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum. The miospore suite consists almost entirely of bisaccate pollen, with minor amounts of angiosperm pollen which are probably caved from overlying Campanian sediments, and rare pteridophyte spores. INTERVAL 2793m-3399m: EARLY SANTONIAN-?LATE TURONIAN Age diagnostic and other significant events recorded from this interval are as follows: 2793m (P) PUK6B LO Chatangiella spinosa RRI (rare), Heterosphaeridium difficile (rare), increased Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum; 3399m (P) ?PUK8A slightly higher abundance of Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides relative to P. pyrophorum, LO Valensiella reticulata, persistently rare C. spinosa RRI and H. difficile. Relatively poor palynological recovery and wide sample spacings conspire against confident biostratigraphic breakdown of this interval, which probably includes the Coniacian and may be as old as late Turonian at the base. An age no older than the early Santonian is established at the top of the interval based on the LO of C. spinosa RRI and H. difficile. Persistent low abundances of these two species in the samples analysed preclude identification of the Coniacian, although regional trends indicate that sediments of this age are present in the well. The Coniacian is possibly included in the large sample gap (over 300m) above the deepest sample analysed from this interval (3399m). No diagnostic dinocyst species were recorded from 3399m, which is very poor palynologically. The occurrence of slightly higher numbers of Palaeohystrichophora infusorioides relative to P. pyrophorum at this depth tentatively suggests late Turonian age, but this feature is too weakly expressed to be reliable. Recovery/Sample quality: Moderate to very poor, samples are considerably modified by cavings and recovery is also affected by resilient drilling mud oil. Palynomorph preservation is moderate, poor at some depths. Palynofloral composition: Palynofloras are dominated by marine microplankton, mainly dinocysts.

The tentative late Turonian age assigned to the interval is based on moderate dominance of P. infusorioides at 3498m. This event is interpreted as being more truthful reflection of the age of the interval than the occurrence of occasional Chatangiella spinosa RRI at the same depth, which is possibly caved.

The succession of palynological events in the interval indicates that the well includes complete early Campanian section. The presence of S. cristatum RRI at 2680m suggests possible Santonian age. However, this species, together with other Santonian-Coniacian indices, is commonly found reworked in early Campanian sediments. The inconsistent distribution of S. cristatum RRI at 2680-2710m and the occurrence of other intra-Late Cretaceous reworking in the lower part of the interval (e.g. Xiphophoridium alatum at 2710m) appear to indicate that S. cristatum RRI is also reworked. Recovery/Sample quality: Good recovery. Preservation of palynomorphs is good to moderate. Kerogen: Dominantly inertinitic debris, with abundant structured sapropels. Woody debris occurs in much smaller proportions at some depths. minor increase in AOM was recorded at 2600m.

Numerically prominent taxa in the interval include Heterosphaeridium? heteracanthum, Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum, Trithyrodinium suspectum and Laciniadinium firmum. The upper part of the interval (2440m-2560m) yielded relatively common and diverse angiosperm pollen, mainly of the triprojectae group. At and below 2600m, the miospore suites consist almost entirely of bisaccate pollen. Reworking: The palynological reworking observed in this interval derives mainly from intra- Cretaceous sources.

However, the event is inconsistent and is not followed downhole by the expected increase in C. spinosa RRI.

Permeability Log permeability (KLOGH in the SFINX database) is estimated from log porosity by the following empirical equation: KLOGH = 10(A+B$vf) where vf is PHIF in the SFINX database. The constants and are found by linear regression analysis of overburden and Klinkenberg corrected horizontal core plug permeability (KLHOB in the SFINX database) versus overburden corrected core porosity (POROB in the SFINX database). Cut-off of net sand was used in this calculation. The correlation is based on core data from the well 6507/7-A-38 in Fangst (Stalheim, 1999).

Shale Volume A shale estimate VSH is calculated based on GR. This is performed in the following two steps: First temporary shale volume (VSH_T) is calculated using the standard method in SFINX (VSHGR). This method is based on the equation. VSH_T = GRGRMIN GRMAXGRMIN with GRMIN = 50, and GRMAX = 190.

This report summarises the data processing and log quality control of the FMS data. Hole conditions are largely the main control on data quality. The caliper data shows washout, rugosity and breakouts over much of the logged interval. This has resulted in poor pad contact and tool sticking and thus resulted in reduced image quality, the intervals from 4365 to 4400 and from 4430 to 4615 beeing most affected. Image quality is generaly very good above 4300 m. Accelerometer and magnetometer data from the GPIT (General purpose Inclinometry Tool) were checked and found to be of good quality. 3. PROCESSING The following corrections were applied to the data prior to image and dip processing: Speed and depth corrections: Accelerometer data from the GPIT were used to perform the main speed correction, after which an image based residual speed correction were applied. EMEX (Emitter-Exciter) voltage correction: EMEX voltage which is varied during acquisition to optimise contrast was corrected for at this stage effectively restoring the low frequency content of the data. Images were enhanced by the method of histogram normalisation. In this method, for given window, the data classes (represented by 42 colour shades) are computed in such way that all colours appear with equal frequency in the resultant image. Two types of normalisation (static and dynamic) were applied. Static normalisation: where the window is the entire length of the logged zone. Dynamic normalisation: where the window of relatively short user specified length ( in this case m) is moved across the image, and separate normalisation computation is repeated for each window. Data classes are interpolated between successive which have large overlap producing the effect of seemingly continuous normalisation.

Ran in hole with the 12  bottom hole assembly and tagged top of cement at 2463 MD, 34 meters above the 13 3/8 casing shoe. The cement plug was pressure tested to 134 bar for 10 minutes prior to start drilling. The pressuretest was OK, but when the drilling started, the cement was too soft. Due to the green cement, drilling operations had to wait for another 10 hours. The mud had to be continously conditioned, because chemicals from the soft cement were destructive for the mud properties. When drilling started again, firm cement was discovered one meter below the 13 3/8 casingshoe at 2498 MD. No LOT or FIT was performed since FIT to sg EMW was taken in the previous wallpath.

Several very high gas peaks were detected both in the Springar and Melke Formations. Most of the high readings came after having drilled through limestone stringers. The stringers have probably acted as seal for the gas. The largest gas peak was so enormous that the gas reading sensors had to be checked. However, no failures were observed. No other sensors on the rig were reading gas. The mud pit volumes showed 300 litre gain while the largest peak was monitored, and the cuttings showed typical gas fluorescense. The well was flow checked prior to continue drilling. Calculations were done to estimate possible pressure outside the casing in the original well, if reservoir pressure had migrated up along the outside of the casing. No calculations gave pressures higher than sg EMW. With mudweight of sg, the overbalance should be sufficient, and it was decided to maintain the same weight. Since these high gasreadings were not seen in the original welltrack, one possible explanation of the high gas content is pressure communication between the two wellpaths. Gas could have migrated up along the outside of the casing in track #1. When it hits the limestone stringers, the gas is accumulated below the stringers, and in areas with permeable rocks, f.ex. siltstone beneath the limestone stringers, the gas migrates out horizontally. There is no doubt that lot of gas was coming, but the mudloggers gas sensors are not calibrated to give very accurate measurements when the percentages exceed the order of 50%.

The WSG has asked for no direct assistance from the offshore personnel in the BHI logging unit. However, in view of the comments made below there has been degree of comfort provided to the WSG in the knowledge that there is competent offshore team of BHI personnel who can be called upon by the WSG if absolutely necessary. This is particularly reassuring for the important Paleocene picks (top Balder, Sele and Lista) and the casing pick. The OSC has been previously informed by e-mail and telephone that WSG is on board and the various staff of the OSC have been informed of the WSG requirements, such as Morning Report data and at what time it was to be sent. This approach on the F15 well therefore tests the Team 2000 concept quite rigorously. This approach by the WSG was not taken on the previous well, F19 12.25 / 13.5 section where the OSC was meant to be shadowing the offshore BHI personnel and was in essence practice /dry run for the present F15 well. In the F19 well at no time during the 12.25 /13.5 section, even at the important top Tor pick, did the OSC contact the WSG regarding reporting procedures, data etc required by the WSG e.g. for compiling the Geological Morning Report or for picking the casing point. In no way could it be regarded that the OSC was pro-active in using the opportunity of the F19 well as dry-run for full-control scenario as envisaged for the current F15 well. 2.6.3 Positives Aspects 1. In theory more pairs of eyes should be viewing the operation, which can improve the level of monitoring (i.e. drilling parameters and MWD log response). had been informed that the OSC would be viewing the same screen view as myself. However, it has become apparent that the BHI operators in the OSC are monitoring more than one well (they are also monitoring Norsk Hydro well). This can cause problems (see comments below). For example while was in the logging unit describing and logging cuttings the screen display of rig-link in the geologists office hung. This was not noticed by the OSC and was not put right until returned to the office and then phoned the OSC. The status of the WSG screen should be monitored by the OSC. 2. Team 2000 is an interesting concept that needs to be further researched in terms of what the objectives of the concept actually are in order for it to proceed and succeed. 2.6.4 Negative Aspects 1. The OSC team has been entirely reactive in their relationship with the Wellsite Geologist (WSG) on this section of the hole. They only respond to requests (by telephone and e-mail) from the WSG. At no stage have the personnel in the OSC on their own initiative contacted the Wellsite Geologist in order to find out what he needs from them or to suggest ways in which the OSC can help. The OSC is not pro-active. 2. have had no feedback from the OSC to suggest that they have been looking ahead at upcoming events (eg faults, the top Balder pick, 5mTVD above the Tor pick), or that they have seen familiarity / correlation with offset wells.

In fact, the Wellsite Geologist has heard no sound from them directly, either first hand, or through the BHI hands in the logging unit, where they themselves (OSC) have initiated the conversation / communication. In general the staff at OSC have not appeared pro-active in discussing the routines to be followed by the WSG in the picking of the casing point 5mTVD above top Tor point.. 3. When the Wellsite Geologist is working in the BHI logging unit, he is bound to ask the occasional question / request to the logger, data operator, MWD operator and Directional Driller, and it has been irritating to be told that one should be speaking to town (OSC) and that you should ask the OSC for data to be sent to certain directory or for log to be printed. It is inconvenient to be looking down the microscope at cuttings and then have to leave the microscope in order to reach for telephone to ask for copy of the MWD log. 4. All requests to the OSC for data and paper copies seem to take long time to be acted upon. When picking the Tor casing point it is imperative that paper copies of the log in TVD format are provided promptly, as would be the case if there were MWD operator offshore. It is exasperating to find that what you tried to explain clearly on the phone, and in e-mail, has not been FULLY understood, and once again you have to go through the entire procedure, in order to get log and / or data, which may have been requested with some urgency. In general it is much quicker to walk over to the unit and describe exactly what you want to the offshore BHI personnel. The WSG can then leave the unit, with satisfactory log copy (or diskette) in his hand. For example on one occasion the OSC was telephone requested by the WSG for print out of the MWD log. This was provided on the printer in the logging unit (after 40 minutes) but minus the all important gamma ray track! 5. Morning report data has not automatically been sent each morning by the OSC to the WSG despite being requested to do so (both e-mail and telephone). The OSC should be more proactive in realising that the WSG does need the data to compile morning report. Is there a lack of communication between the personnel in the OSC in making sure that all personnel are aware of the WSG requirements? 6. Despite being told of file format problems Morning Report data has consistently been sent to the WSG in incorrect file format. 7. Morning Report data has not been sent to the geologist promptly, thus delaying compilation of the geologists morning report. It has been arriving as late as 0900hrs. It has to be available by 0700hrs at the latest. 8. telephone request to the OSC for data and print out of the log by the WSG resulted in being told to wait and ring back as the OSC was talking to the other rig! This is potentially serious problem. Who takes priority for the OSC time /attention? 9. It is apparent with this extra link (i.e. the OSC) to the communication chain that there is opportunity for misunderstanding and delay. We now have introduced potential 'weak link', and there is resultant increase in stress / worry for the WSG when picking the crucial point 5mTVD above top Tor. i.e. will TVD print out of the MWD log be available when requested from the OSC.

I suggest that more contact is made between the WSG and the OSC personnel prior to drilling the important sections of the well - the top Tor casing pick and the reservoir section. The OSC personnel will then be more aware of the activity and role of the WSG and hence the OSC can be more pro-active in the process and thus assist the WSG in picking the casing point successfully and in drilling the reservoir section and completing the well satisfactorily. . 2.6.6 Further Incident On the morning of 10th October, whilst drilling ahead, the Wellsite Geologist (Stuart Robinson) called the OSC to talk to the MWD operator only to be told he had had to return home to look after his children because his wife had had to go into hospital. There was backup MWD engineer based offshore who had taken over from the onshore operator and the geologist obtained the information he required. However, as the plan is to remove the offshore engineer once the pilot phase is over, this type of situation could arise again and then there could be no guarantee of cover being maintained until replacement engineer is found. When based onshore, not many people will wait for relief to arrive, before dashing off to be with their family in an emergency.

However, despite several attempts to get the AutoTrak to respond the inclination dropped from 64 deg to deg by 4050m MD (survey depth 4016m MD). The problem was believed to be due to excessive sleeve rotation. At 4050m MD drilling was stopped to circulate for samples and to evaluate the consequences for the reservoir section if the inclination remained at deg, or continued to fall to an expected 58 deg at entry point. This showed that the wellpath could drop as much as 20m TVD into the Hod Formation, which would lose over 500m MD of reservoir section. If the angle remained at deg the well would not be economical. The inclination at entry needed to be increased to 65 deg to reduce the length of reservoir section lost in Hod to less than 300m MD. During the evaluation of this situation, the AutoTrak tool stopped pulsing altogether meaning not only could it not steer correctly, but also that log data could not be obtained, meaning the tool had to be POOH. At surface it was found that the turbine section had failed meaning no power was being supplied to the logging or steering packages of the AutoTrak.

It was decided to set cement plug at about 3760m MD and then drill sidetrack T3. The intention of T3 was to re drill the Middle and Early Eocene and the Palaeocene section of the hole to TD approximately 2mTVD above the top of the Tor Formation and approximately 12m to the left of the T2 section TD. The T2 section was therefore thought to be useable as good go-by well section (lithology, MWD log character and biostratigraphy data) for calling section TD close to the top of the Tor Formation. The run commenced with washing down to top of cement, which was tagged at 3766m MD at 0800 hrs. The MWD data was recorded into memory while washing down to tag the top of the cement and would therefore provide tie-in section. The engineering aspects of tagging the top of the cement in open hole (T2) and attempting to kick off were considered of prime importance and consequently flow rates were erratic while washing to the top of the cement hence the MWD tool may have been recording data erratically. From 3760m MD the MWD tool was recording data into memory and real time and thus will provide good tie-in. The T3 sidetrack was kicked off at 3775m MD and new formation was time drilled. The drilling was time controlled in order to fulfil the requirements of obtaining the desired well trajectory. At 3947m MD the hole was circulated clean for hours as during drilling, the ECD and other parameters indicated that the hole was not being cleaned fully of the cuttings generated at the bit. Poor hole cleaning was result of sliding rather than rotating, low flow rates and low RPM all limited by the BHA configuration, ECD and the MWD tools close to the bit. After further pause in drilling for circulation and hole cleaning, drilling continued with no problem to section TD just above the Tor Formation. The separation from the T2 wellpath was approximately 25m.

The mud weight was reduced to 12.5ppg from 12.9ppg while circulating at the top of the 7 liner. tie-in MWD log was performed logging up through the Hod / Tor formation contact at 4318m MD where there was some gamma ray log character (base of the Tor Formation). Drilling in the Tor Formation re-commenced with no difficulty and with hole angle of 88 degrees. It was felt that hole angle would have to be reduced as the measured depth increased as the likelihood of penetrating the top of the Tor Formation was considered to be significant risk. This risk was associated with the uncertainty of the actual dip of the Tor Formation and the overlying Lista (varied from degrees to degrees) and the uncertainty in the geological model of the thickness of the Tor Formation (c to 10mTVT). With some difficulty the angle of the hole was reduced after approximately 12 hours down cutting the borehole between 4520 to 4530m MD. The angle then dropped dramatically to degrees at 4541m MD when drilling ahead. This was far too low but it then became very difficult to build angle through the Tor Formation. The Hod Formation was re-entered at 4603m MD with borehole inclination of degrees. Drilling in the Hod Formation was straight forward except for being unable to build angle to climb out of the Hod and back into the Tor Formation  possibly due to hard ground. Hole angle was finally built up to degrees at 4923m MD and the azimuth of the well was turned to the right in order to line the well path up within the target box. During the drilling of this section the cuttings samples cleaned up to nearly 100% chalk lithologies and the amount of Lista cavings reduced to trace. The angle continued to be built up to 92 deg to climb out of Hod and into Tor. The well track re- entered the Tor Formation at 4988m MD, after drilling total of 386m MD within the Hod. At 5073m MD, the GR and Resistivity curves indicated possible penetration of Lista at 5057m MD. Samples were circulated and confirmed that Lista had been penetrated, 69m MD after re-entering Tor from the Hod, and climbing only 0.5m TVD. Density data from the bed boundaries suggested a formation dip of deg, which would mean Tor thickness of 7m TVD at the point Lista was penetrated. However, formation dip of deg, which was calculated from actual tops along the well path and confirmed by density data within the Hod, would suggest Tor thickness of approximately 4m TVD. A further 16m MD were drilled into the Lista to log the density tools across the point where Lista was penetrated to obtain memory imaging data, that would be later analysed to confirm if the Lista penetration was via fault or merely thin Tor. The bit was then pulled back to 4883m MD to commence sidetrack (T8).

The first attempt was made at 4883m MD (2598.52mTVD) and the successful second attempt was made at 4890m MD, both within the Hod Formation. Drilled ahead to target 10m TVD below the point where T7 entered Lista. At this point the wellpath remained in the Hod and the plan was to drill ahead at 88.5deg to slowly re-enter Tor away from the suspected thin Tor seen on T7. At 5162m MD the Tor was entered and an apparent formation dip of 5deg was calculated from this data point and the top Hod seen in T7. Although the plan called to drill at 87.5deg inclination once in the Tor, due to the apparent formation dip of 5deg, and the fact that Tor was prognosed to thin to less than 7m TVT between 5300 and 5400m MD, it was decided to err on the side of caution and drop the hole inclination to 85 deg. Log responses indicated the wellpath was staying low within Tor and separation of the resistivity curves below 5275m MD suggested being close to the Tor-Hod boundary. At 5310m MD the well path again entered Hod. The apparent formation dip from the data points at 5310 and 5162m MD was 3.8deg. Attempts to increase the inclination to 88 deg to re-enter Tor by sliding proved difficult and building angle was achieved by combination of sliding and increasing WOB in rotary mode. The azimuth was also showing signs of drifting to the right, which would have resulted in the wellpath missing the target box at TD, but this was corrected also by sliding. Tor was re-entered at 5465m MD, giving an apparent formation dip of deg. Drilling continued with the intention of holding the angle at deg to climb slightly within the Tor unit, but the natural dropping tendency of this assembly meant the inclination dropped to 85.9 deg by 5539m MD. Gas levels began increasing around 5510m MD, partly due to increased ROPs, caused by trying to increase the hole inclination by drilling quickly, and partly due to increasing pore pressure. Connection and background gases increased and, at 5560m MD, the mud weight was increased from 12.3ppg to 12.5ppg. Once this was circulated around gas levels decreased to approximately 3% and another stand was drilled down to 5589m MD, where bottoms up were again circulated. Gas levels rose to 12% and it was decided that the mud weight limit for drilling ahead had been reached and this marked the TD of the well. Mud weight was increased to 12.9ppg prior to pumping out of the hole.

The logging was in the 8.5 section of the well which was drilled with 1.23g/cc OBM  This was near vertical well with 4.7deg at TD  The tool string was configured with standard probe dressed with large face packer for pressure testing due to the potential for unconsolidated sands and Sentinel mandrel was configured with the XR sentinel packer for sampling.  The string consisted of fluid analysing modules (IFX), one in Sample line and the other in Perimeter line which was used for clean-up monitoring and determining real time fluid properties.  The tool string also consisted of 717cc  885cc sampling pump combination with two 6-tank (WA) carriers with single phase tanks. of the tanks were charged with bar nitrogen and the other were charged with bar nitrogen.  Tests were conducted with the large face packer(LFP) between the depths of 1,947.59 MD to 2,118.40 m MD mainly top to down, except stations 1943.7m MD and 1987.5m MD that were taken on the way up.  The pressure and sampling stations were picked from the petrophysical log by the client.  The pressure tests and the sampling are summarised in the following sections. 1.1 Pressure Test Summary  Pressure measurements were conducted at 35 depths with total of 107 pre-tests.  Pressure and temperature stability criteria, along with pressure repeatability among repeat pre-tests were used to assess the quality of the tests.

The Middle/Early Eocene boundary is conformable. An intra-Early Eocene stratigraphic break spanning most or all of palynofloral Zones PE1-PE/P1 occurs at the Hordaland/Rogaland Groups boundary (2105m[log]). The presence the Sele Formation in the succession is established mainly on the occurrence of Subzone PP5A, which is restricted to this unit. stratigraphic hiatus spanning palynofloral Subzone PP5B may occur at the Eocene/Paleocene boundary. The Upper Lista Formation spans palynofloral Subzones PP4D to upper PP3D (post-acme of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum), whereas the acme (>70%) of P. pyrophorum occurs immediately below the Heimdal sandstone. This indicates that the Heimdal Formation lies entirely within Subzone PP3D. The acme of P. pyrophorum in the underlying mudstones suggests attribution of this unit to the Lower Lista Formation. This unit is believed to range into Subzone PP3C, the evidence for which occurs caved in the Vle Formation. The basal Late Paleocene is represented by highly condensed but probably complete succession in the uppermost part of the Vle Formation. The Late/Early Paleocene boundary is interpreted as being conformable. Analyses terminated within late Early Paleocene calcareous mudstones of the Vle Formation. 25/11-G-20A WELL Analyses commenced in olive grey mudstones of the Horda Formation, Early Eocene in age. The lower part of the Horda Formation includes palynofloral Subzone PE1B, which is absent in most of the Grane Field wells studied; the absence of planktonic microfaunal Zone ME(P)1, which is weakly represented in some of the other Grane Field wells, is attributed to unfavourable depositional environment at this locality. A thin sandstone is present within the lowermost Horda Formation, at 2556m(log)-2558.5m(log). Palynological evidence suggests that this sandstone may be laterally equivalent to the Frigg Formation. Considerable amounts of palynological reworking from the Balder, Sele and Lista Formations occur in the lower part of the Horda, together with reworked tuffaceous mudstones typical of the Balder Formation.

The presence of palynofloral Zone PE/P1 in the succession indicates that the uppermost part of the Rogaland Group is attributable to the Balder Claystone, which has not been encountered in the nearby wells, where the Horda Formation directly overlies Balder Formation sediments of Subzone PP5C age. A stratigraphic hiatus is probably developed at the Eocene/Paleocene boundary, with the upper part (basal Eocene) of the Sele Formation being absent or condensed beyond biostratigraphic resolution. The remainder of the study section consists predominantly of Upper Lista Formation mudstones spanning palynological Subzones PP4D to ?PP3E. No evidence was seen for the presence of Subzone PP3D in the analysed samples, indicating that the base of the study interval in this track is younger than the basal Upper Lista to uppermost Heimdal Formation succession in the 25/11-G-20T2 well. 25/11-G-20AT2 WELL The youngest sediments analysed are intra-Late Paleocene, Upper Lista Formation mudstones of palynological Subzone PP4C age. The succeeding mudstone unit (below about 25m of Heimdal Formation sandstones) yielded thin layer of Subzone PP3D (2625m), overlying Subzone PP4C mudstones with superabundant Areoligera gippingensis. The occurrence of Subzone PP3D at 2625m is interpreted as reflecting Lower Lista Formation mudstone intrusion within the Heimdal - Upper Lista succession. The underlying Upper Lista mudstones span palynological Subzones PP4C to PP3D (upper). The main Heimdal Formation unit lies between mudstones yielding Subzone PP3D above, and Lower Lista mudstones with the intra-PP3D event below. The intra-PP3D event occurs again at 2750m,.in thin mudstone interbed within the Heimdal Formation. This may represent another Lower Lista. intrusion within the sandstone or, alternatively, it may be interpreted as marking the true top of the intra-PP3D event in the succession. The oldest interval in the study section lies at 0m, in Lower Lista Formation mudstones of intra-Subzone PP3D age. These contain sporadic palynological reworking from the basal Lower Lista and Vle Formations, Subzones PP3C-PP2. The horizontal well path in the Heimdal Formation sandstone is of Subzone PP3D age.

The age at this depth is therefore considered to be intra-Late Paleocene. The Upper Lista Formation spans palynofloral Subzones PP4D to upper PP3D (post-acme of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum). This suggests that in this well the underlying Heimdal Formation sandstone lies entirely in Subzone PP3D. The high gamma ray mudstones at the top of the Lower Lista Formation are biostratigraphically characterised by the acme of P. pyrophorum. This unit is believed to range into Subzone PP3C, the evidence for which occurs caved in the Vle Formation. The basal Late Paleocene is represented by highly condensed but probably complete succession in the uppermost part of the Vle Formation. The microfaunas are almost exclusively represented by an agglutinated assemblage of generally high diversity throughout the interval.

Microplankton associations are moderately to poorly diverse. The Spiniferites ramosus group is abundant through most of the interval; Apectodinium spp. are abundant at 0m. Areoligera gippingensis is abundant from 2690m down. Palynological Comments: The palynofloral succession in the lower part of the interval (2850m and below) appears to be obscured by cavings. decrease in the abundance of Areoligera gippingensis at 2850m is interpreted as marking penetration of sediments of Subzones PP4B-?PP3E age, but due to cavings these units cannot be differentiated in the ditch cuttings analysed. The sporadic occurrence of abundant A. gippingensis within this section is interpreted are reflecting increased cavings, although this cannot be fully ascertained in the absence of sidewall core / core samples. No evidence was seen in the closely spaced samples analysed for the high abundances of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum (Zone PP3D), which occur just above the Heimdal Formation in the 25/11-G-20T2 well. Although the in situ palynofloras in the lowermost part of the Upper Lista Formation in the 25/11-G-20A well seem to be considerably diluted by cavings, at least at some depths, the expected increase in Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum is normally evident even in poor samples. The absence of this event suggests that sediments of Subzone PP3D age were not penetrated in the studied section, and that the deepest samples analysed are younger than the top of the main Heimdal Formation sandstone in the 25/11-G-20T2 Well.

While several original approaches have been considered for FTWD tools, the GeoTap tool resembles conventional WFT adapted to drill collar. The GeoTap tool design is similar to many probe style wireline tools, where donut shaped rubber pad forms seal around metal snorkel. When this probe configuration is pressed against the wellbore the snorkel penetrates the mudcake and contacts the formation to make the pressure measurement. The GeoTap tool collar has been integrated into the real-time Sperry-Sun Measurement and Logging While Drilling (M/LWD) system. Tools are available in , , 8, and 1/2 tool size. The GeoTap tool can be used to take pressure measurements in boreholes from   18. Wherever possible, proven downhole M/LWD components were used. This includes using field-proven Quartz Gauge with accompanying electronics. In this case, the Sperry Pressure While Drilling (PWD'T) gauge section is used that has been in service for more than three years. The use of the PWD electronics provided reliable memory and communications (GeoSpan'T) system to operate and control the GeoTap tool downhole. Further considerations were made in designing the tool to ensure that it was compatible with ongoing drilling operations and yet simple enough to maintain at the well site. The tool is capable of operating while the rig pumps are active (i.e., pumps on) with no apparent detrimental effect on the data quality. Having the pump on is preferred mode of operation because it reduces the potential of differential sticking and keeps the wellbore and mud system conditioned. Operation of GeoTap Tool The GeoTap tool can be run as typical tool section and uses existing Sperry-Sun M/LWD technology. This enables it to be deployed with other M/LWD tools and use the same data uplink and downlink capabilities. Most of the runs to date have been with the GeoTap tool in combination with several other LWD sensors including BAT'T Sonic, MRIL-WD'T magnetic resonance and GEOPILOT'T rotary steerable system. The GeoTap tool operation is pre- programmed with timed sequence of events. The time to operate has been kept to minimum such that (at circa minutes from start to finish) it is analogous to making slow connection. The timed events can be altered by sending downlink signal to the tool so that it can adapt to changing formation conditions. When an initialization downlink command is sent to the tool to start the sequence, the sequence will continue unless the tool detects system error. If an error is detected or system power is lost the probe is automatically retracted. As fail-safe mechanism, there is hydraulic accumulator in the tool that maintains reserve of hydraulic fluid at system pressure to automatically retract the probe in the event of power loss. Furthermore, the probe can be sheared with 100,000 pound force if the accumulator loses pressure. With the tool positioned on depth (determined from the real-time responses from the M/LWD tool string) the downlink command is issued from the surface to initiate the test. The downlink is achieved by using the GeoSpan'T technology and the Insite'T software package. This allows the operator at the surface to transmit through the mud column down to the M/LWD tool. The pressure signal from the surface is received and decoded by the PWD pressure sensor (located within the GeoTap tool) and the arming instruction is confirmed by sending command back to the surface. On receipt of the downhole confirmation, second pressure signal is sent by the surface GeoSpan to start the execution of the pressure test in pumps on mode. If it is desired to perform the pressure test with pumps off (as when PDM motor is\", 'Passage_id': 439}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/7-Z-4 H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: PO Box 200, Stavanger 4065, Norway April 2021 Confidential Page 80 part of the BHA), then the pressure test sequence starts as soon as circulation stops (a short delay can be applied in advance of the probe setting). Pressure data are actually recorded from pair of pressure transducers located within the tool. The GeoTap tools primary pressure transducer is the annular PWD quartz transducer. strain gauge transducer is also available with both gauges recording at 5Hz sampling rate. Once the test sequence is completed the probe is retracted, additional data are transmitted and drilling can continue. Real-time data transmission can occur concurrently with the pressure test sequence if the pumps are on while testing. If the pumps off mode is selected the data transmission occurs immediately after the sequence has ended The complete set of pressure data is stored in the tool memory and is downloaded at the surface when the tool is retrieved. It was recognized early in the tool development that just transmitting pressures was not sufficient to evaluate the pressure test data quality. For this reason the additional parameters were added to the data transmission so that the drawdown and buildup data could be characterized as curves that reflect the full data set recorded downhole. Notice that the Pstop and Pfu pressures are transmitted with 0.1psi and psi resolution respectivly. Comparing these two pressures gives the operator an immediate indication of the stability of the buildup. The other parameters are described in further detail under the topic of real-time data transmission. Real-Time data Transmission: The pumps-on telemetry protocols are ideal for the GeoTap real-time data transfer. The GeoTap tool fully emulates the PWD annular pressure-while-drilling measurement whilst not activated for test. However, on command from the surface, an equalizer valve closes to isolate the gauge manifold from the annulus and the pre-scripted pressure test sequence runs automatically. The PWD/FTWD duality (where by the pressure data is written in parallel to both the PWD annular and FTWD test records) and pumps-on operation means that the pressure test transient is available as fast updating (~ every second) annular pressure only PWD data stream (with psi resolution) during the test for visual QC , along side the downhole processed analysis of the pressure transient : In effect, during test, the HCIM controller interrupted the routine / continuous FE data and switched to transmitting only the pressure transient data. This visual presentation parallels the downhole data regression and transmitted FTWD data results: Phyd1 and Phyd2, the drawdown start and the stop pressures and the shut-in pressure at the end of the build-up period. Apart from the shut-in / stop pressure, which has psi coded resolution, the other pressures have data compression applied which is 8psi. The pretest rate, volume and build up time can be changed during the FT test if the previous build up time is long enough (96 seconds).', 'Passage_id': 440}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/10-17 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: SUMMARY Hydrocarbons were encountered in the Brent sands (2684.5 - 3000 mRKB), mainly in the Tarbert and Ness Formation.

Figs. to 12 compare the water saturation from logs with the water extraction from core. For the Garn Fm. (Fig. 1) both cores and logs show Sw from to which proves the high HC saturation in Gam Fm. In the Ile Fm. the Sw values from these two methods are in the same range. For the Tilje Fm., the Sw from Dean & Stark extraction is higher compared to the logs. Some of this change may be due to the core heterogeneities taken from the thin silt and clay layers. The chlorite in Tilje Fm. will also have some effects on the higher Sw values from cores. 4.3 Permeability 4.3.1 Introduction The established permeability model for the Smorbuldc Field is based on cores, logs and test data. Evaluation of permeability within the field is difficult due to the reservoir complexity: variety of sedimentological lithologies vary rapidly within the reservoir sequence, and diagenetical processes such as quartz cementation and illite authigenesis have seriously reduced the original porosity and permeability of the sediments. On the other hand, chlorite-coating of quartz grains has resulted in preservation of much of the original porosity and permeability in some of the sandstones within the Tilje and Are Fms. Due to the reservoir complexity with changing sedimentary facies and diagenesis and due to the poor log quality, it is difficult to establish field model for the permeability. 4.3.2 Core permeability The core permeability has been corrected for KlinIcenberg, fibrous illite, induced microfracture and overburden. These corrections are described in section 3.2. The porosity - permeability crossplots (Reference 1)show no correlation between porosity and permeability. For the Garn, Ile and Tofte Fms. there is significant variation in permeability for porosity interval from p.0 to 11 p.u. The possibility of secondary porosity may explain this variation in permeability with almost constant porosity. The porosity - permeability plot for the Tilje Fm. shows very poor correlation indicating the problem with the complexity of depositional environment and diagenesis.', 'Passage_id': 446}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/12-10 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 4.3.3 Log permeability '7 In the absence of porosity - permeability correlation the Horizon model has been used. The Horiszon is statistical approach for permeability prediction (Reference 2). This method consists of two main processes. The first being the process of building database (a multivariate histogram) by integrating selected log measurements with core permeability data (the variable to be estimated) over intervals where core data exist. The second step involves the process of querying (consulting) and establishing database in order to predict permeability data over intervals without core permeability using the logs to locate the most probable permeability estimate at each depth. Since some of the logs (density and neutron) are badly affected by washouts, the final porosity, water saturation and GR were used as main estimators for permeability. Reservoir building blocks (Reference 1) were also used for correlation with the sedimentological classification. The CPI logs and Figs. to 11 show quite good correlation between the estimated permeability curve and the available core data. 4.4 Net sand The Smorbuldc reservoirs are heterogeneous with large variations in reservoir quality. For the Garn, Ile and Tofte Fms. the reservoir quality changes by depth having good producing sand in the upper part of the structure and low producing and tight sands in the middle and lower part of the structure. For the Tilje Fm. the good producing sands are mainly in chlorite coated zones. For zones without chlorite coating there are mainly low producing sand for the upper part and tight sand for the lower part of the structure. For the Tilje Fm. 20 - 30%. of this formation consists of shale/shaly sand. For the Gam, Ile and Tofte Fm. the fraction of shale/shaly sand is lower. Based on the above observations sand / shale model has been established using the following criteria:  Good producing sand (net sand) is sand with permeability > 10 mD. This includes sand mainly located structurally high and sand with chlorite coating on quartz grains.  Low producing sand (net sand) with the permeability in the range - mD <k< 10 mD.  Tight sand with permeability lower than - mD.  Shale / shaly sand with Vsh > Net sand includes both good producing sand and low producing sand. The main problem with the net sand definition is to distinguish between low producing sand and tight sand. There is no sharp boundary between low producing sand and tight sand. Some of the low producing sand is not expected to produce HC due to large distance between the production wells and barriers between the well and the net sand zones. Some of the tight sand will probably produce mainly around the\", 'Passage_id': 447}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/12-10 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: STATO production well or close to good producing sand with high draw-down. In reality, some tight zones will probably give some production and some net sand zones will not produce. Since most of the hydrocarbons are found in low permeable formations (0.001 to 1mD) the estimation of producible reserves is very sensitive to the definition of net sand. For the net sand definitions the following considerations must be made: Offshore vs. onshore fields Offshore fields have different net sand cut-offs due to higher costs, lower well densities and shorter production time than the onshore fields. For low permeability onshore fields the net sand cut-offs may only be based on the shale content (Vsh) or the sedimentological facies. For this low permeability offshore field both shale content, pore geometry/permeability, fluid system and heterogeneities must be considered to distinguish between producing and none producing sand. Fluid Dry gas, condensate and oil reservoirs have different cutoff criterias due to the varying capabilities of the fluids to flow in porous media. Liquid drop out will also affect the cut-offs. Pore geometry / permeability Radius of the pore throats and the differential in radius of the pore throats compared to the radius of the pores also affects the productivity of low permeable formations. Heterogeneities, barriers, fractures and stimulation Natural fractures and stimulation will increase the communication in the reservoir. Heterogeneities and barriers may prevent production from permeable zones. This illustrates the difficulties in net sand definitions. The net sand determinations must be based on different cutoff methods and each method should reflected the arguments above. Permeability, capillary pressure (R35), RFT, Rt/Rxo separation, sedimentology and petrology data are used for defining net sand. A cut-off on permeability is the most common criteria for defining net sand. Porosity and Vsh cutoffs can not be used since there is no permeability - porosity correlation. There is also no change in the permeability when going from low-permeable clean sand to shaly sand. Permeability cutoffs of 0.1mD (oil) and mD (gas condensate) have been used.These values have been correlated with the other methods below. Permeability and cutoffs from other relevant producing offshore and onshore fields have also been investigated. Most of the publications of cutoffs of low permeable formations are from dry gas onshore fields with permeability cutoffs as low as mD. For offshore fields mD (oil), mD (gas condensate) and mD (dry gas) are standard cutoff values. A useful indicator of potential productivity is the pore throat radius. Here, the R35 methode has been investigated. This is an empirical relationship between porosity, permeability and the pore aperture corresponding to mercury saturation of 35 % (Winland equation). micron has been used as the minimum limit due to the best agreement with the other net sand cutoffs. 97 sealed FMT measurements are available from these two wells. These are very useful for distinguishing between tight sand, almost tight sand, low-permeability sand and good sand.', 'Passage_id': 448}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/12-10 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: STATOIL Saga Petroleum a.s. Asgard The reservoir quality and hence net sand distribution is controlled both by primary sand quality and diagenesis. This relation is complicated and has not been used in the net sand calculation. The contributions of the different sedimentary facies associations to net sand have also been investigated. The 10 most sandy facies associations contribute to net sand and three of these dominate the net sand intervals: channel sandstones, deposits from the amalgamated channel complex and sub-tidal channels. Distinguishing between bound and free fluids from the NMR log are still ongoing. This log can provide new improvements for net sand calculation. 4.5 Nuclear magnetic resonance Numar MRIL (Magnetic Resonance Imaging Log) was run for well 6506/12-10A. The objective for running this log was to get: - Capillary-bound water in chlorite coating zones - Fluid-filled effective porosity - Producible fluid type (oil, water or both) based on free fluid index and saturation from other logs - Permeability / productive sand Evaluation based only on logs shows that both oil and water are producible fluid in Tilje Fm. (Fig. 11). This high fraction of producible water may be due to noise on the raw logs (high temperature) and interpretation problems with chlorite (iron, paramagnetic material). The final NMR evaluation will be done when the results from the NMR core measurements are available (1.4 -96). 4.6 Pressure data and fluid contacts A barrier study has been performed for the whole Smorbulck Field based on pressure and fluid data (Reference 1). Between each of the five reservoir formations on the Smorbuldc Field there are pressure barriers. For both the Garn and Ile Fms. the pressure and fluid analysis show fluid communication within each formation. For the lower part of the structure these formations are almost tight sands with no communications. The Tofte Fm. is tight for most of the wells with net sand only in the wells 6506/12-1 and 6506/12-6.

The tool string included an extra-large-diameter probe (XLD), Saturn probe and standard probe (STD) for Vertical Interference Test (VIT). InSitu Fluid Analyzer (IFA) was used for fluid identification. The formation pressure was evaluated from MD to MD. Six samples were acquired during this run: one water sample at mD (station file no.17), one oil sample at MD (station file no.14), two wet gas sample at MD (station file no.12), and two oil samples at MD (station file no.10). After two sampling stations, special tests were conducted for the purpose of estimating pressure and temperature at which the first gas bubbles liberated from the liquid hydrocarbon. These tests were acquired while pulling out of hole through recording pressure and temperature in the closed flowline, where fluid similar to the sampled fluid remained. Such measurements give only an approximate estimate of the bubble point pressure, as well as, results will also depend on the level of OBM filtrate contamination of the sampled fluid. Tests were made at 2611.5m MD (station file no.11) and 2032.5 MD (station file no.25). Test results indicated first gs bubbles been detected at about bars for oil at 2511.5 MD when the temperature was 76 degC, and bars for oil at MD when the temperature was 51 degC. Permanent datum is mean sea level. All Wireline depth measurements were referenced to the drill floor which was located 23 above mean sea level. Depths for all stations were correlated to Run 1A ZAIT-NGI-GR log dated 29th of November 2019. Pretest Interpretation Summary Formation pressure was evaluated at 44 stations. At four of these stations, pretests were performed with both XLD probe and STD probe. At one station, pretests were performed both before and after pumping. At another nine stations, drawdown mobility was also calculated based on the main flow period. Hence total of 58 pretests are presented in this report. All pretests were processed and evaluated using InSitu Pro software. Only data from the quartz gauge was used for interpretation, although the strain gauge compared well with the quartz gauge.

Run 1C Station 21 (2409.5 MD): total volume of 10 was pumped out from formation at this depth using XLD probe. No sample was captured at this depth. Pumping was aborted at early stage because the objective at this station was to confirm the existence of hydrocarbon. The pumped fluid is predicted to be mixture of small volume of formation oil with high volume of OBM filtrate. The time interval chosen for the fluid fraction display on the depth view plot is: - 44 min, before the pump was stopped. Maximum recorded pressure drawdown during pumping was ~ 47 bars. Run 2A Station 14 (2409.5 MD): total volume of 83 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the Saturn probe. One SPMC bottle (SN: 04) was filled. The sampled fluid is predicted to be mixture of oil with OBM filtrate, and the contamination level is expected to be less than 10 wt%. The time interval chosen from the fluid fraction display on the depth view plot is min, when the last sample was taken. The maximum drawdown was ~ bar. Run 1C Station 18 (2428.5 MD): total volume of was pumped out from formation at this depth using XLD probe. Two MPSR bottles (SN:3188 & 3298) were filled. At around 25 min, the probe was observed to be possibly partially clogged due to sand flowing with pumped fluid. Flow rate was decreased to the minimum in attempt to avoid the probe being completed plugged and samples were acquired shortly afterwards. Thus the sampled fluid is predicted to be water with some low contamination level of OBM filtrate. The time interval chosen for the fluid fraction display on the depth view plot is: 48 - 50 min, when the last sample was captured. Maximum recorded pressure drawdown during pumping was ~ 149 bars. Run 2A Station 12 (2596.7 MD): total volume of 107 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the Saturn probe. One MPSR bottle (SN: 3050) and one SPMC bottle (SN: 119) were filled.

Run 1C Station 12 (2598.8 MD): total volume of 64 was pumped out from formation at this depth using XLD probe. One MPSR bottle (SN:2677) and two SPMC bottles (SN: 087 & 067) were filled. At around 80 min, the pumped fluid was observed to be flowing in two-phase, with flowing pressure drawdown of bar (below formation pressure). Therefore, flow rate was decreased to the minimum, and flowing pressure drawdown was consequentially dropped to ~1.8 bars. Less free gas was observed coming out of the solution, although the pumped fluid was still flowing in two- phase (see Figure 6.6.9 on page 81). Hence the sampled fluid is predicted to be mixture of formation oil in two-phase and OBM filtrate, and the contamination level of OBM filtrate is probably about 10 wt%.

Interval Pressure Transient Testing Summary Run 2A Station 24 (Saturn: MD, VIT: MD): total volume of 178 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the Saturn probe. The pretest from Saturn showed drawdown mobility of mD/cP and the pretest from the VIT probe was tight. Two main flow periods and two build-up periods were conducted after the pretest: a main flow period of hours followed by build-up period of hour, and then the second flow period of hours with 1/2 flow rate of the first one followed by build-up period of hours. Spherical and radial flow regime could be observed for the last build-up interval as shown on model identification plot (Section 7.1.6.2) under IPTT section. Run 2A Station 16 (Saturn: MD, VIT: MD): total volume of 71 was pumped out from formation pretest from the VIT probe showed drawdown mobility of mD/cP. The main flow period of hours was conducted after the pretest, followed by build-up period of hour. The pressure changes at the Saturn probe reached the pressure gauge resolution shortly after the build-up started, due to relatively higher permeability. Hence no flow regime was identified. For the same reason, no conclusion can be drawn from the pressure response at the VIT probe, even though it indicates possible vertical connectivity. Run 2A Station 12 (Saturn: MD, VIT: MD): total volume of 107 was pumped out from formation pretest from the observation probe was tight. The main flow period of hours was conducted after the pretest, followed by the build-up period of hour. Radial flow regime could be identified for the last build-up as shown on model identification plot (Section 7.3.6.2). Run 2A Station 10 (Saturn: MD, VIT: MD): total volume of 98 was pumped out from formation pretest from the VIT probe was tight. The main flow period of hours was conducted after the pretest, followed by the build-up period of hours.

Introduction to The Analysis Test Programme This report presents the results of gas permeability tests undertaken at Corpro Data on samples from well 6608/10-6. The objective of the study was to give supplementary data to the routine core results, due to reduced data set caused by problems taken the planed number of plugs. The drilling and preparation of plugs was especially difficult due to unconsolidation and inhomogeneousity. Many samples crumbled during the soxhlet solvent cleaning. The measurements undertaken were performed on the slabbed B-cut using probe permeameter (or mini permeameter). One track containing probe measurements were made on three lengths (re Run 1-3) comprising metres in pilot project. Measurements were made every one cm, where possible. The results were correlated to the Klinkenberg corrected gas permeability. The pilot project was followed by additional measurements performed on metres. This report firstly describes the procedures. Secondly the permeability results are presented for each metre in both tabular and graphical form In this section detailed explanation to the two different parts of this project has been given. Photographs of the cut are shown close to the results. The appendices comprise the correlation coefficient procedure and photographs of the plugs used in the second part of this study. Statoil's internal identification no. was Core-99-76. Corpro's internal identification no. was: Sta203. The work was performed by experienced operators/analysts with necessary qualifications within their field. All work has been done in accordance with updated routines existing for special core analyses in Corpro Data. The technical equipment and precision instruments used for the analyses are calibrated and tested on routine basis. For further information please refer to our Quality Assurance manual. The contact from Statoil was Wibeke Hammervold Thomas. The test period for the special core analyses were from October to December 2000 and in May 2001. A copy of this report (preliminary issue) has been examined by Statoil personnel and their comments and requirements have been implemented in this final report.

Test System and Procedure The Statoil designed and built probe permeameter (or mini permeameter) was used for this work. Measurements are made by lowering probe onto the sample surface, using sealing pressure of one bar and flowing nitrogen gas through this. The gas flows through the sample to the atmosphere in roughly hemispherical geometry (for homogeneous material). tip seal made from soft rubber prevents leakage between the probe tip and the sample surface. Completion of the measurement is made by recording the flowrate and injection pressure at steady state (see diagram below). standard 3mm internal diameter probe tip was used. The external diameter was 7mm. The measured gas flow entering the sealed area is function of: 1. Sample permeability at the point of injection. 2. Gas injection pressure. 3. Viscosity of the gas at the injection pressure. 4. Gas slippage (Klinkenberg) effects at low injection pressure. 5. High velocity flow effects at low injection pressures. 6. Sealing quality between the probe tip and the sample surface. 7. Size and shape of the tip seal. 8. The geometry of the gas flow path in the sample. Factors to can be measured or otherwise estimated, and with the gas flow determined, the permeability at the point of injection can be calculated using the appropriate form of the Darcy equation.', 'Passage_id': 454}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6608/10-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The core surface was vacuumed to remove loose grains and dust prior to measurements being made. Cleaning of the probe tip is aided by small brush device. A leak test has been performed daily. The probe tip is lowered onto smooth impermeable surface and gas flowed to the tip. Pressure and flowrate are then monitored to check for leaks. Leak detection fluid is also applied as an extra check. The system normally operates automatically. However, the fractured and inhomogenoues cut required some of the measurements to be performed by the operater checking that the data would be representative for the core. Measurements are omitted for the following reasons: missing core, preserved sample, too great surface irregularity, core badly broken up or rubble, large cracks or fractures or plug holes. A red value reported, indicates that measurement has not been possible on such occasions or where the flow rate was too high for permeability to be calculated. A green value is used when there has been insufficient permeability to measure. The equipment is calibrated at the beginning of each study, or whenever new probe tip is used. This involves making miniperm measurements on set of six homogeneous check plugs. These cover wide range of permeability (approx. 5mD to 3600 mD). 3x3 mm grid of measurements are made on the central portion on the top and bottom of each plug (18 per plug - top and bottom). The average of these 18 measurements is then obtained for each plug. This value is then related to the actual four point Klinkenberg gas permeability values obtained using Hassler sleeve permeameter. Twenty core plugs from the actual well were used to investigate the relationship between the probe permeability measurements and the kel. This information was used to produce correlation coefficient to use for correcting the probe permeability measurements. In addition 3x3 mm grids were made on the cut on the location where the plug had been cut. This was performed to find the relationship between the clean end surface of the plug and the uncleaned cut. This part of the procedure is reported in the appendices. The objective of the study was to perform one track probe measurements on the B-cut. The track was located cm from the left edge of the core. The measurements were made every one cm, where possible. The following settings were used throughout the study as follows. The time out value was minutes. This is defined as the maximum time allowed for each measurement. timeout reading of permeability will occur if stable reading of flow cannot be achieved, or if the flow reading is less than the minimum flow. The maximum flow and pressure variations were set to + or  5%. This is the limit within which the flow and pressure must be stable. The value is the % of the reading. The flow and pressure stability times were set to seconds. This is defined as the time during which the flow and the injection pressure must be stable within the limits given in maximum flow and pressure variations, before measurement is accepted. The above settings are considered suitable for core which exhibits wide range in permeability.', 'Passage_id': 455}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6608/10-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 3. Results This study started as pilot project to investigate if the results from use of the Statoil designed and built probe permeameter (or mini permeameter) could be used for low permeability measurements. Previous projects had shown that for low permeability measurements the correction procedure resulted in data that didn't correspond very well with the routine plug data. The pilot project was enlarged step by step and finally it comprised three lengths (re Run 1-3) from the re formation. One track containing miniperm measurements were made on the three lengths of the B-cut comprising meter. re Run - Together with measurements on core plugs from the same depths procedure was made for correcting the probe permeability data. This is documented in Section 4.1. Then Statoil added lengths to the project including also the Melke and Garn formation. This included poorly consolidated zones from which probe permeability measurements were difficult to do. Anyway, the following lengths were measured and included in this project. Garn : 1862-1871.59 Unfortunately the plugs available for making corrections according to the procedure (section 2.1) made in the pilot project were limited. As consequence different approach was used for this part and this is outlined in Section 4.2. A segment of the core photographs representing each measured length of the B-cut is shown together with the results in this section. In the pilot project only white light photographs were available whilst for the second part of the programme both white light and ultra violet photographs are presented. The corrected probe permeabilities (k'el) are reported both in tabular and graphical form. The scale represents the permeability span from to  mD. Therefore, values less than and greater than  mD reported in the table do not show in the graph. The results from the routine core plugs are also presented. Please note that all values are plotted, including red values for removed rock for preservation (seal peels). The graph and photograph presented to the right of the table has been adjusted by hand. It should be taken into account when reviewing this section that such method do not allow 100% accuracy between the table and graph/photograph. As an improvement to the reporting red line on each photograph representing the track of measurements performed with the probe permeameter was introduced. This was introduced in the time between the two parts of the project and explains why this technique has not been used for the pilot project. As consequence of the nature of the rock included in this project and because of change of the procedure due to improvements, the data have been determined and presented differently. However, it has been decided to present the results according to depth.\", 'Passage_id': 456}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6608/10-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 4. Appendices 4.1 Converting Probe Permeability Measurements into Klinkenberg Corrected Gas Permeability (kel) Results for The Pilot Project. 4.1.1 Probe Measurements Performed on The Clean Plug Surface versus kel The objective of this part of the study was to determine correlation coefficient or correction factor (CC1) which could be applied to convert the probe measurement into Klinkenberg gas permeability values obtained using Hassler sleeve permeameter. By finding good relationship the probe permeabilities could be supplement to normal plug measurements. In cases with limited recovering of core plugs or bad condition of the plugs due to fractured and inhomogeneous structure of the rock, these additional data can be of great help. For this study it was also of great importance to map thin layers by the large sampling density provided by the probe permeameter. Twenty routine core plugs covering wide range of permeabilities (kel) were selected. 3x3 mm grid of measurements were made on the central portion on the top and bottom of each plug (18 per plug - top and bottom). Obviously incorrect single results and not measurable points were excluded and the average of the remaining measurements were then obtained for each plug. However, for most of the samples the average value was based on all 18 measurements. The relationship between this value (kg plug) and kel is shown graphically below. The detailed results are presented in table in Section 4.1.3. Klinkenberg corrected gas permeability (mD) kg plug k probe=kel Probe permeability (mD) The comparison of data suggested that the minipermeability results should be corrected according to the magnitude of the result.', 'Passage_id': 457}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6608/10-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 4.1.2 The Relationship between The Clean Plug Surface and The Uncleaned Cut. In the previous section the relationship between the cleaned rock surface and kel was investigated and correlation coefficient was determined. In addition to this correction the probe permeameter response to untreated core was investigated. It is reasonable to think that remains of hydrocarbons and salts could effect the measurements. The preparation and drying of the cut could also contribute to difference between the two measurements. In that case the use of correction factor based on only the clean plugs could give less accurate results. The investigation of the probe permeameter response to untreated core was therefore executed. The relationship between the probe permeability measurements performed on the end surfaces of the selected correlation test plugs and the surface of the untreated B-cut (kg cut) is shown graphically below. The kg cut values were based on 3x3 mm grid of measurements located as close as possible to the plug hole. The detailed results are presented in table in Section 4.1.3. Probe permeability from measurements on the cut (mD ) Probe permeability on plug ends (mD) From this comparison which shows reasonable linear relationship between the two measurements through the whole range of permeabilities, it was considered that additional corrections to CC1 was superfluous. However, the depths which gave the largest difference should be noted and it should be considered if further investigation is necessary when evaluating these sections of the rock. Remark: Grid measurements on the cut/plugs were repeated/checked in the cases where kg plug and kg cut deviated more than expected.', 'Passage_id': 458}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/4-M-3 H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: HALLIBURTON PO Box 200, Stavanger 4065, Norway 18 December 2020 Log Header HALLIBUR ir,  GeoTap Formation Pressure Tester Pre'' INSITE rrl ill 4 fill .= It. f. ; Fi :51. 2x nQany Equlnor ii , rr , rr. ce Company : Equinor Rig  Transocean Spitsbergen Well .

The first is called the sigma which is measure of how closely the data conforms to the Exact model and is reported in  pressure units (normally psi). The sigma is determined by calculating the standard deviation of the data from the theoretical curve as follows.  bu ( ) =   (pi()(Pi))2 bu (n 1standard deviation  pressure units (normally psi) Pbubuildup pressure from Exact curve fit (see Fig. 1) p(i)..................................measured buildup pressures i....................................................index of data point n.......................total number of pressure points used The second method of measuring the test quality is the pressure and temperature stability. The Pressure Stability and Temperature Stability are determined using linear regression over the time period specified (i.e., default of 30 sec) and reported for each selected stop pressure. The stability can be either positive or negative. The stability period can be modified if desired in RTS. The source data for this derivative is the pressure gauge selected by the engineer for formation pressure which is normally the Quartz gauge closest to the probe. There are some exceptions to the stability period during buildups which are outlined below. 1. Start of buildup continue stability calculation until the buildup time reaches the stability period (i.e., 30 default). 2. Reset stability period to 1/3 of the buildup time (10 seconds default). 3. As the buildup progresses increase the stability period using 1/3 of the buildup time until the specified stability time is reached (30 sec default).', 'Passage_id': 460}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/4-M-3 H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Confidential Page 86 Flow Rate Determination There are three methods of determining the drawdown (and pumping) flow rates which can be selected in the Job Parameters. In the newer tools the flow rate is measured and the Automatic Method is the preferred default. In older tools the flow rate or test volume can be specified but the values must be entered manually. With any of these three options it is rare that the volumes and rates exactly match that specified by the engineer since there is variability in the actual execution of pretest and the rates and volume in RTS are determined from actual events and measured data. Automatic Flow Rate Option The automatic flow rate option determines rate from the measured rate curve(s) directly. For pretesting the averaged rate between the selected starting and ending times of the drawdown is used (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd). It is possible to select Tend_dd that may not fall within the drawdown period and still estimate the mobility using the averaged rate for the drawdown period chosen. When this happens the simulated drawdown curve is turned off. For both pumping and pretesting the rate should be determined from the active rate curves. Since some tools like the RDT can have more than one pretest module or pump the total average from all the rate curves are used to for the Automatic Rate calculation. Then the volume for the drawdown is determined by using this averaged rate times the drawdown time (i.e., AvgRate/(Tend_dd-Tstart_dd)). However, the time used to average should not exceed 30 minutes which would apply to pumpouts or miniDST testing and it is desirable to determine the rate just prior to the buildup. In this case the averaged rate would be from Tdd-30 minutes to Tdd. Also, rates less than cc/sec from Meas PT Rate are filtered out (set to values) and rates less than cc/sec for Pump Rates are set to before averaging. Manual Flow Rate Option With this option selection in the Job Parameters the rate is fixed to the value entered. The volume of the pretest is determined by multiplying this rate time the drawdown time period selected (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd). Manual Volume Option With this option selection in the Job Parameters the volume is fixed to the value entered. The rate of the pretest is determined by dividing this volume by the drawdown time period selected (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd).', 'Passage_id': 461}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 15/9-7 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A pore pressure gradient, fracture gradient and overburden gradient have been predicted for well 15/9-7 by analysing well 15/9-5 and 15/9-4 which were drilled on the neighbour structures to the E-structure where 15/9-7 will be drilled.

The Optimized Test consists of multiple repeat tests of up to three drawdown-buildup (DD-BU) cycles for each test station. They are represented by three individual final buildup pressures and three mobility values. The latter are calculated using tool internal algorithm, which is based on Formation Rate Analysis FRASM (see below for further information). The measurements are taken while circulating (flow-on). The before and after annulus pressure measurements are influenced by hydrodynamic effects and do not represent hydrostatic mud pressure. The formation pressure measurement is, under normal conditions, not affected by the mud flow. Client Delivery Package Two types of the Client Delivery Package are offered. Both packages include reports, data plots and data files of each run, performed with TesTrak: The Standard package mainly comprises automatically created reports and data files, delivered real-time as well as right after tool memory dump ('Rig-Floor' delivery). These are: Uplink Table, Run Summary Report, and LAS files. In addition, the Extended package includes detailed interpretation of each test. This package is delivered only on request. The interpretation within comprises an analysis based on FRA, which is well-known from Baker Atlas wireline service, such as RCITM. Data are delivered with the FRA Report. Uplink-Table (Real-time) A Microsoft Excel table that contains real-time data of each test-station performed. Besides the most important data - depth, pressure and mobility - it comprises large variety of information, which helps to make further decisions real-time. Some of them are lowest DD pressure, temperature gradient, or overall test time (including pad eject, testing and retract). As an additional feature, quality indicator - the QualityBit (QB) - helps to evaluate each test without time delay. This QB is automatically determined in the tool, based on the results from the tool FRA calculation as well as the FBU stabilization criteria. Run Summary Report (Memory - 'Rig Floor') An Adobe PDF document that shows general as well as specific information of each test-station performed. As TesTrak is able to perform Multiple Repeat Tests ('Optimized Test'), each test- station is represented by History plot composed of up to three tests (pressure, volume, temperature vs. time), Modulo plot (pressure vs. time) and data table. Modulo plots are intended to amplify the data part of the FBU pressures, which helps to QC the stabilization criteria for specific test. The data for modulo plots are listed in the Data LAS files.\", 'Passage_id': 465}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6407/7-A-10 BY1HT3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: B82 11 Date: 2003-04-26 08:00 Ran in the hole with the whipstock retrieving assembly from 700 to 3948 m. 08:30 Made up the topdrive and broke circulation.

Contamination of control lines for TRFC-H valve was experienced despite full certification from third party vendor on the flushing job carried out on- shore. Schlumberger did only request NTU qualification on the flushing job This qualification should in the future also include maximum allowed water- content. It is also recommended that the service company representatives offshore are made responsible for verifying control line flushing and fluid quality testing of lines and fluids relevant to their own equipment as part of their pre-job check list. 4.2 WellDynamics Production Packer. When attempting to test the 9-5/8 Well Dynamis HF1 packer on the rig floor the Well Dynamics procedure was followed with the result that the internal parts of the packer moved relatively to each other and had to be laid out. The procedure should be to pick up the packer without shear screws and with test dogs installed when pressure test have to be done on the rig floor. 4.3 TRFC-H (Proto type equipment). A-10 was originally planned to be equipped with proto type 5-1/2 TRFC- H Hydraulic operated sliding sleeve. Due to last minute failure of the Schlumberger supplied 5-1/2 TRFC-H valves it became necessary to re- place this equipment by installing 3-1/2 TRFC-H in the well to obtain zonal control of the multilateral branches.

The Middle/Early Eocene boundary is conformable. An intra-Early Eocene stratigraphic break spanning most or all of palynofloral Zones PE1-PE/P1 occurs at the Hordaland/Rogaland Groups boundary (2105m[log]). The presence the Sele Formation in the succession is established mainly on the occurrence of Subzone PP5A, which is restricted to this unit. stratigraphic hiatus spanning palynofloral Subzone PP5B may occur at the Eocene/Paleocene boundary. The Upper Lista Formation spans palynofloral Subzones PP4D to upper PP3D (post-acme of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum), whereas the acme (>70%) of P. pyrophorum occurs immediately below the Heimdal sandstone. This indicates that the Heimdal Formation lies entirely within Subzone PP3D. The acme of P. pyrophorum in the underlying mudstones suggests attribution of this unit to the Lower Lista Formation. This unit is believed to range into Subzone PP3C, the evidence for which occurs caved in the Vle Formation. The basal Late Paleocene is represented by highly condensed but probably complete succession in the uppermost part of the Vle Formation. The Late/Early Paleocene boundary is interpreted as being conformable. Analyses terminated within late Early Paleocene calcareous mudstones of the Vle Formation. 25/11-G-20A WELL Analyses commenced in olive grey mudstones of the Horda Formation, Early Eocene in age. The lower part of the Horda Formation includes palynofloral Subzone PE1B, which is absent in most of the Grane Field wells studied; the absence of planktonic microfaunal Zone ME(P)1, which is weakly represented in some of the other Grane Field wells, is attributed to unfavourable depositional environment at this locality. A thin sandstone is present within the lowermost Horda Formation, at 2556m(log)-2558.5m(log). Palynological evidence suggests that this sandstone may be laterally equivalent to the Frigg Formation. Considerable amounts of palynological reworking from the Balder, Sele and Lista Formations occur in the lower part of the Horda, together with reworked tuffaceous mudstones typical of the Balder Formation.

The presence of palynofloral Zone PE/P1 in the succession indicates that the uppermost part of the Rogaland Group is attributable to the Balder Claystone, which has not been encountered in the nearby wells, where the Horda Formation directly overlies Balder Formation sediments of Subzone PP5C age. A stratigraphic hiatus is probably developed at the Eocene/Paleocene boundary, with the upper part (basal Eocene) of the Sele Formation being absent or condensed beyond biostratigraphic resolution. The remainder of the study section consists predominantly of Upper Lista Formation mudstones spanning palynological Subzones PP4D to ?PP3E. No evidence was seen for the presence of Subzone PP3D in the analysed samples, indicating that the base of the study interval in this track is younger than the basal Upper Lista to uppermost Heimdal Formation succession in the 25/11-G-20T2 well. 25/11-G-20AT2 WELL The youngest sediments analysed are intra-Late Paleocene, Upper Lista Formation mudstones of palynological Subzone PP4C age. The succeeding mudstone unit (below about 25m of Heimdal Formation sandstones) yielded thin layer of Subzone PP3D (2625m), overlying Subzone PP4C mudstones with superabundant Areoligera gippingensis. The occurrence of Subzone PP3D at 2625m is interpreted as reflecting Lower Lista Formation mudstone intrusion within the Heimdal - Upper Lista succession. The underlying Upper Lista mudstones span palynological Subzones PP4C to PP3D (upper). The main Heimdal Formation unit lies between mudstones yielding Subzone PP3D above, and Lower Lista mudstones with the intra-PP3D event below. The intra-PP3D event occurs again at 2750m,.in thin mudstone interbed within the Heimdal Formation. This may represent another Lower Lista. intrusion within the sandstone or, alternatively, it may be interpreted as marking the true top of the intra-PP3D event in the succession. The oldest interval in the study section lies at 0m, in Lower Lista Formation mudstones of intra-Subzone PP3D age. These contain sporadic palynological reworking from the basal Lower Lista and Vle Formations, Subzones PP3C-PP2. The horizontal well path in the Heimdal Formation sandstone is of Subzone PP3D age.

ROGALAND GROUP Balder Formation:2105(log) - 2119.5m(log); Age: Early Eocene The upper boundary of the Balder Formation is marked on wireline logs by sharp downhole increase in gamma ray values at 2105m (log). The in situ lithologies are considerably diluted by cavings from the Horda Formation.

An intra-Early Eocene stratigraphic break spanning most or all of palynofloral Zones PE1-PE/P1 occurs at the Hordaland/Rogaland Groups boundary (2105m[log]). The Eocene/Paleocene boundary coincides with, or occurs just within, the Sele Formation. stratigraphic hiatus is probably present at this boundary, although this cannot be fully ascertained due to condensing. In the upper part of the interval (Horda Formation), microfaunas are dominated by fine to medium grained, flysch type agglutinated foraminifera displaying variable abundance and diversity (high between 5m, becoming progressively lower). Deposition likely to be within an upper to middle bathyal setting. The occurrence of calcareous benthonic foraminifera in minor amounts throughout the Horda Formation interval would suggest at least some degree of water oxygenation at the sediment/water interface. Recovery/Sample quality: Moderate, becoming poorer towards the base. Preservation: Moderate to poor. Agglutinated fauna exhibits light grey to light brownish grey colour, occasionally off white.

The age at this depth is therefore considered to be intra-Late Paleocene. The Upper Lista Formation spans palynofloral Subzones PP4D to upper PP3D (post-acme of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum). This suggests that in this well the underlying Heimdal Formation sandstone lies entirely in Subzone PP3D. The high gamma ray mudstones at the top of the Lower Lista Formation are biostratigraphically characterised by the acme of P. pyrophorum. This unit is believed to range into Subzone PP3C, the evidence for which occurs caved in the Vle Formation. The basal Late Paleocene is represented by highly condensed but probably complete succession in the uppermost part of the Vle Formation. The microfaunas are almost exclusively represented by an agglutinated assemblage of generally high diversity throughout the interval. The assemblage reflects what was probably middle to lower bathyal setting with dysaerobic conditions prevalent to some degree. Minor amounts of pyritised and non-pyritised diatoms appear in the uppermost part of the interval and may indicate period of silica enrichment. Recovery/Sample quality: Poor to moderate at the very top of the interval becoming moderate from 2130m to the base of the interval. Preservation: Moderate. Predominantly light grey occasionally greyish green in colour, fine to medium grained. Diatoms display both pyritised and non pyritised preservation. Microfaunal composition: Agglutinated foraminifera predominant throughout with low numbers of diatoms present in the uppermost part of the interval. Rare radiolaria occur towards the base of the section. Recovery/Sample quality: Poor at 0m where cavings dominate, good elsewhere in the interval, Kerogen: Dominant structured sapropels, with secondary amounts of humic debris. Palynofloral composition: Miospores dominate the palynofloras in the upper part of the interval (2 5m). Marine microplankton dominate in the remainder of the interval. Miospore suites at the top of the interval are characterised by abundant (and dominant) Inaperturopollenites spp. Elsewhere, the in situ miospore associations consist almost entirely of bisaccate pollen.

The Optimized Test consists of multiple repeat tests of up to three drawdown-buildup (DD-BU) cycles for each test station. They are represented by three individual final buildup pressures and three mobility values. The latter are calculated using tool internal algorithm, which is based on Formation Rate Analysis FRASM (see below for further information). The measurements are taken while circulating (flow-on). The before and after annulus pressure measurements are influenced by hydrodynamic effects and do not represent hydrostatic mud pressure. The formation pressure measurement is, under normal conditions, not affected by the mud flow. Client Delivery Package Two types of the Client Delivery Package are offered. Both packages include reports, data plots and data files of each run, performed with TesTrak: The Standard package mainly comprises automatically created reports and data files, delivered real-time as well as right after tool memory dump ('Rig-Floor' delivery). These are: Uplink Table, Run Summary Report, and LAS files. In addition, the Extended package includes detailed interpretation of each test. This package is delivered only on request. The interpretation within comprises an analysis based on FRA, which is well-known from Baker Atlas wireline service, such as RCITM. Data are delivered with the FRA Report. Uplink-Table (Real-time) A Microsoft Excel table that contains real-time data of each test-station performed. Besides the most important data - depth, pressure and mobility - it comprises large variety of information, which helps to make further decisions real-time. Some of them are lowest DD pressure, temperature gradient, or overall test time (including pad eject, testing and retract). As an additional feature, quality indicator - the QualityBit (QB) - helps to evaluate each test without time delay. This QB is automatically determined in the tool, based on the results from the tool FRA calculation as well as the FBU stabilization criteria. Run Summary Report (Memory - 'Rig Floor') An Adobe PDF document that shows general as well as specific information of each test-station performed. As TesTrak is able to perform Multiple Repeat Tests ('Optimized Test'), each test- station is represented by History plot composed of up to three tests (pressure, volume, temperature vs. time), Modulo plot (pressure vs. time) and data table. Modulo plots are intended to amplify the data part of the FBU pressures, which helps to QC the stabilization criteria for specific test. The data for modulo plots are listed in the Data LAS files.\", 'Passage_id': 522}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-A-11 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Final Well Report, Well 2/4 A-11A Section 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Well 2/4 A-11 was originally completed in 1975. This well was sidetracked as well 2/4 A-11A due to collapses detected both in the Ekofisk formation (1985), and in the overburden (1991). 2/4 A-11A was completed in June 1993 as an Ekofisk only producer 650' northwest of the original location. The well was drilled to total depth of 12,040 ft MD RKB, with maximum inclination of 29.2. The well was sidetracked below the 20 casing shoe @ 1601' MD, and five string casing design was used as planned when drilling the new wellbore. The well was completed with 41/2, 13 96 Cr tubing string, and 15' intervals were perforated in the Ekofisk formation. The time required to drill, complete and test the well was 90 days, as estimated. Total trouble time on this well was 230 hours, which is % of the total time of 2160 hrs spent on the well. Major Engineering and Operational Achievements  Drilled the 121/4 section down to Mid Lista (from 5317' to 10,945' MD) with single rotary assembly using an ATM-G3 bit. Significant Deviations from Planned Program None Major Operational and Equipment Problems  Spent 15 days and 12 mills to mill 1824' of 954 casing.  Spent 20 days and 14 mills to mill 1482' of 133/8 casing, changed milling service company during the job.  Switched from top drive to kelly during the 133/8 milling operation due to severe overtorqued drillpipe, and to prevent the top drive from severe fatigue.  Used Nodeco's cement kelly because of space restrictions. Problems due to overheated and leaking kelly swivel makes this unsuitable for future milling operations.  The POLYVIS milling fluid was contaminated with the mud left in the annulus when milling the 133/8 casing into old 171/2 open hole, and lost all of the yield point and gel strengths. This mud had to be replaced by new mud system based on drispac/ bentonite.  Shock sub failure during milling caused hours downtime.\", 'Passage_id': 523}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6607/5-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 2.8 Geochemistry  Geochemical analyses of well 6607/5-2 were performed at Simon - Robertson Laboratories in England. Canned drill cutting samples at 10 intervals from 1240 to 4680 were collected at the wellsite and sent to Simon-Robertson for detailed geochemical analysis. sample was analyzed every 60 m. A small number of additional samples between 2480 and 2900 were also analyzed. The following analyses were performed on all or some of the samples: - Airspace gaseous (Cl - C6) hydrocarbons - Occluded gaseous (Cl - C6) hydrocarbons - Gasoline range (C4 - C7) hydrocarbons - Lithological description - Total organic carbon - Rock-Eval pyrolysis - Solvent extraction - Extraction fractionation - Alkane gas chromatography - Spore colouration and kerogen description - Vitrinite reflectance Details of procedures, tables, charts and interpretation are included in Simon-Robertson's report and Esso's updated block evaluation report. In summary, no oil or significant gas source rocks are present. The kerogen type is predominantly of vitrinitic and inertinitic composition which have poor gas source potential. The TOC values are low throughout the well. Between 4190 and 4380 the residual organic carbon is slightly higher than in the rest of the well. The well section is immature for hydrocarbon generation to about 3300 and early mature for oil from 3300 to about 3600 m. rapid transition from early maturity above 3600 to over maturity towards the top of the first igneous intrusive (3 5.5) is noted. Sediments in the interval 2 are over mature for oil. 2.9 Seismic Tie A synthetic seismograph has been prepared using density and sonic logs combined with velocities from the VSP survey.

At this point, 70 of formation was cored and of core was recovered. Drilling continued to total depth of 3667 and terminated in the Lange Formation. Induction, Density, Neutron, Spectral Gamma Ray, Oil Based Diplog and Array Sonic wireline logs were successfully run. When running an level Vertical Seismic Log, the tool became temporarily stuck at 3090 m. After coming free with the VSP toolstring, wiper trip was conducted, followed by running the Modular Dynamic Testing Tool. Pressure points were recorded in the Lysing and Brygge formations and fluid samples were taken from the Lysing Formation. The Vertical Seismic Log was successfully re-run. The final log run was Sidewall Core Gun, with 29 cores recovered out of 53 shots attempted. Abandonment Open hole cement plugs were placed across the Lysing Formation, the Brygge Formation, 13 3/8 casing shoe and in the top part of the 13 3/8 casing. The two last plugs were pressure tested to 70 bar above the formation leak-off pressure at the shoe. The oil-based mud was displaced with seawater before the BOP and riser was recovered. It took two attempts to cut the 20 extension joint and 30 conductor before recovery was possible. The ROV performed a seabed survey. While laying down drill pipe, recovery of the anchors and chains took place. The rig was released to Statoil at 01:12 hrs on 19th of August.

The samples were under-saturated with gas, rich in organic acids and traces of phenols were present. The Lysing sand package is present, but has thinned and partly shaled out at the crest of the structure. The 3m sand at the very top top is of good quality but is water filled. The solution gas, the organic acid content and the phenol concentration indicate that the sampled water has been in contact with hydrocarbon accumulation. The water is strongly under-saturated with gas and is not in close contact with hydrocarbon accumulation at present. 2.4 Operational Safety Results vs. Objectives The objectives for the well were: 1. Establish functional Safety Management System in compliance with regulatory requirements. 2. Avoid accidents and loss during project execution. Take necessary preventive measures to limit the consequences if accidents should occur and thereby provide safety for personnel, external environment and property. 3. Provide operational solutions and emergency preparedness measures that, as total for the project and rig, provide good health and working environment, reduce risk and minimise pollution. 4. Operate with the minimum of discharges and emissions, both with respect to quantities, toxicity, and other environmental impacts. 5. Establish functional emergency preparedness system in Compliance with Chevron and Regulatory requirements. And the following sub goals for the PL259 project were established:  Development of an HS&E awareness throughout the total organisation that provides necessary attention to HS&E in planning, procurement, drilling and reporting tasks being performed. This is obtained by active management and active involvement of participating HS&E organisations.  Continue to utilise waste segregation on the Byford Dolphin.  Health and environmental friendly chemicals to be preferred.  Reduce exposure of personnel to hazardous situations and accidents by focusing on injuries and ill health which cause absence from work; special attention will be paid to lifting operations. The lessons learned reviews following the project did indeed verify that the PL 259 HSE objectives established were met, both regarding the personnel and environmental aspects.', 'Passage_id': 543}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: From the lessons learned reviews there were three particular aspects which were seen to contribute to the successful outcome on the PL 259 project;  full openness in all regulatory matters between Norsk Chevron and the Norwegian Authorities.  Use of well known advisors and contractors (i.e. RC Consultants, DNV, MediTeam, Aktiv Beredskap, Vest Drill and NorSea Logistics services) in the Norwegian Petroleum industry for local guidance through the various Authoritys consent processes.  Extended co-operation with Chevron Europe HSE expertise. A total of 43 RUHs (undesired event reports; equivalent to combination of Stop cards-Incident reports) were registered. There were three incidents reported to the Authorities;  Casing buckling incident  Well influx incident  Falling objects (nut and bolt from derrick) incident The Authorities commented upon the openness shown when reporting incidents and the time requirement of two hrs for serious incident to be reported to the NPD was not met although verbal notification was made official. The timing until any serious incident is registered with the NPD is an area which needs improving for the next Norsk Chevron operation in Norway. The onboard HSE incident reporting was satisfactory. practice that was utilised for HSE follow-up, namely weekly rig-shore telephone meeting was found to be worth while and is recommended for future drilling operations. In addition the use of regular compliance meetings (for follow-up of outstanding regulatory deviations) was found most useful, both prior to and during the drilling campaign. Regarding discharges from the drilling operations, water based drilling fluids were used at the top sections, whilst oil based drilling fluids were used for the lower section. With exception of the waterbased displacement fluids, no chemicals were discharged to sea at the lower section. Cuttings from the oil based drilling section were brought onboard the Byford Dolphin, collected in enclosed containers and shipped ashore for disposal. A separate assessment of the development of the environmental risk was not conducted for this project (this is the first PL 259 well). The Environmental risk assessment concluded that this isolated exploration drilling operation was relatively low environmental risk (both for the coastline zone and the sea bird populations) and below the ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) region found in Norsk Chevrons accepted criteria. In the area specific environmental risk assessment, the environmental effects are categorised as minimum, mainly due to the fact that the majority of the drilling waste which is discharged consists of cuttings and inorganic waste from the drilling chemicals.

High-risk, shallow gas filled sands was neither prognosed nor observed in this well. low to medium risk shallow gas hazard was defined at 1180-1270m, albeit considered to be dim spot caused by lithological change across debris flow/slump deposit. No significant increase in gas readings were observed from that same level during drilling, leading to the conclusion that the dim spot was indeed set up by geophysical contrast between debris flow lithofacies and a laterally located background facies. Two prospect target levels were defined and prognosed in this well, the Paleogene Brygge sands and the Cretaceous Lysing sands. One of the main objectives was to identify and evaluate these sands. Only the Lysing target contained sands (21m gross TVT sand interval). One of the partners had an additional Cretaceous Nise sand as primary prospect target, and this particular potential sand unit was added to the prognosed lithocolumn by the Operator as high risk sand lead to accommodate our partner. The Lange sands were also added to the prognosed lithocolumn as high risk sand lead. Neither the Nise nor the Lange sands were present in this well. Paleogene, Brygge Target (Harran Prospect) The seismic sequence defined as the Brygge Target contained parts of the Tare Formation (from 1654m MDRKB) and the upper part (37m) of the Tang Formation and contains disappointingly 104m of siliceous diatomite and volcanics (tuffaceous) facies. If the upper part of the diatomaceous Tare Formation and the above Brygge Formation is added the total diatomite thickness is around 140m MT (Measured Thickness). SEM and XRD results prove that diatomite (also containing Radiolarians and sponge spicules) is the dominant lithofacies with some component of volcanic glass. The unit was water filled and significantly over-pressured. 38% average porosity (representing high microporosity witihn the diatom tests) and very low permeability were recognised in the diatomite. The only presence of hydrocarbons was from the gas log data indicating some amount of methane present when the formation back-flowed in saltwater kick. The lack of reservoir was the main failure in this prospect. Failing of the vertical seal (faults?) during inversion is seen as the most likely cause for this Brygge back-flow zone being water bearing. Cretaceous, Lysing Target (Grong-W Prospect) The seismic sequence constituting the Lysing target was some 50m thick in the well, but the Lysing Formation sandstone unit was only thick (TVT) out of which at best some 3m of the uppermost sands had porosity of 20%. The Lysing Formation sandstone thinned and fined out more than expected at the crest of Structure indicating that Structure was paleo-high during the deposition of the Lysing Formation. The solution gas, the organic acid content and the phenol concentration of the water obtained from wireline fluid sampling indicate that the sample has, at some point been in contact with February, 2002 Rev.: 1-TAGD Norsk Chevron AS', 'Passage_id': 548}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 6506/3-1, PL259 hydrocarbon accumulation. The water is strongly under-saturated with gas and is not in close contact with hydrocarbon accumulation at present. Failure of the vertical seal is the most likely cause for this Lysing Formation sandstone being water bearing. 3.2 Well Stratigraphy Introduction The 1:500 Composite log (Enclosure 3) is helpful when reading this chapter. Reference is also made to Ichron (2001A) and Ichron (2001B) for petrography and biostratigraphy respectively. The prognosed and the actual lithocolumns are shown in Figure 3.2-1 and the prognosed and actual stratigraphic tops are compared in Table 3.2-1 and Table 3.2-2. Except for the Top Nise prognosis, all actual tops came inside the estimated uncertainty range in the prognosis. The reason for this error on the prognosed top Nise was caused by the seismic pick being phantomized through most of the study area due to very poor seismic response. The main target (Top Lysing Fm) was encountered 17 deeper than expected and well within the +155m -125m uncertainty range. Seabed The rig was oriented such that the anchors and the anchor chains did not interfere with some identified and mapped positive mound features scattered on the seabed inside the site survey (potential coral colonies). The well was drilled between closely spaced iceberg scours. Quaternary deposits, (341.0)  (426.0) MDRKB (TVDSS) (Mid? Plesitocene  Holocene, Neogene) The well was drilled with returns to seabed down to 1382m MDRKB. The lithology description for this unit is therefore based on the well logs and offset well information. This uppermost stratigraphic package consists of unconsolidated clays, silt-sands and boulders. No boulders were encountered at this level, but boulders have been recorded in numerous wells all over the Mid-Norwegian shelf supporting their presence close to this well bore also. The site survey only recognised boulders on the high-resolution seabed map. The vertical seismic sections did not have sufficient resolution to image boulders. (Late Pliocene - Early-Mid? Pleistocene, Neogene) These deposits range from over-consolidated clays with pebbles and occasional boulders in the upper section down to about ~700m, passing into predominantly clays with minor silt stringers down to 1100-1200m. The lower section, below ~1100-1200m to 1624.0m MDRKB contains more consolidated claystone with minor silts and sand stringers. Below 1382m MDRKB, cuttings were available for lithological description generally confirming the prognosis. The clays are dominantly light to medium grey with occasional green/grey and brown clays. Traces of limestone, pyrite, micromicaceous material and shell material occur throughout the formation. The base of this unit is an erosional unconformity and the unit is itself base-lapping onto the structurally inverted and partly eroded Brygge Formation. Medium to medium dark grey to greyish green claystone were encountered, occasionally coloured dark yellowish green, being soft to moderately firm, sub-blocky to amorphous and sticky in places. Traces of', 'Passage_id': 549}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: carbonaceous material, occasionally micromicaceous and rare traces of pyrite have been recognised in this claystone. The unit is non- to occasionally moderately calcareous. (Miocene, Neogene) This stratigraphic unit is absent in the well due to erosion and non-deposition, resulting in significant erosional unconformity and large hiatus across 1624.0m MDRKB (see below). (?)Chattian Unconformity: A large hiatus is present in this well at 1624.0m MDRKB. Erosion and non-deposition caused the development of significant regional unconformity. The hiatus ranges from the onset of the Oligocene to the close of the Miocene stage. The erosion causes the absence of the Kai Formation and the youngest part of Brygge Formation in this well. The unconformity is tentatively correlated to the super-regional Chattian unconformity related to general uplift of the western Fennoscandian shield. Superimposed inversion and associated erosion/non- deposition related to the plate-tectonic opening of the Norwegian Sea during the Tertiary probably caused further enhancement of this unconformity. (Early Eocene  Mid Eocene (Possibly partly incl. Late Eocene?), Paleogene) The top of this formation is an erosional unconformity consisting of pale yellow, very fine sandstone grading to siltstone and claystone according to cuttings. Three sidewall cores indicated diatomaceous and tuffaceous (volcanic glass) facies. This facies becomes purer diatomite downward into the Tare Formation and indicates gradual, but incomplete change from from Opal to Opal CT in the same unit. The ultimate Opal CT transition depth is probably slightly deeper than base of the diatomite facies (>1740m MDRKB). (Early Eocene, Paleogene) The Tare Formation consists of light grey to grey diatomaceous and tuffaceous facies within background lithofacies of grey to grey green with some brown claystone, possibly with thin limestone and sandstone stringers. The mineralogy of this facies changes gradually, but incompletely from Opal to Opal CT. The 100% Opal CT depth, however, is probably slightly deeper than base of the diatomaceous facies (below 1740m MDRKB). SEM images and XRD analyses on SWC samples qualitatively proved the diatomaceous facies and the Opal-A/Opal-CT trend and hence overrule the limited and often misleading information from the cuttings, missing (meshing) out on the minute diatom grain sizes. The 40-60% micro- porosity and very low permeability make the diatomite very poor reservoir unless fractured. (Late Paleocene  Earliest Eocene, Paleogene) The Tang Formation consists of light to dark grey and green/grey claystone with occasional meter-thick sandstone and limestone stringers. Here also (in the upper 25m of the unit) beds of diatomaceous facies has been inferred based on the character calibrated to SEM and XRD results from the sidewall cores in the Tare formation. The description of cuttings renders no information on diatomite identification for reasons given above.', 'Passage_id': 550}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: (Early Campanian Early Maastrichtian, Late Cretaceous) This interval consists mainly of medium to dark grey and olive grey claystone with limestone and dolomite stringers. The unit is firm, sub-blocky, micromicaceous, occasionally with silts and traces of carbonaceous material. Crystalline pyrite is locally common Occasional stringers of micro- to cryptocrystalline dolomite also occur. (Late Santonian  Early Campanian, Late Cretaceous) This unit consists mainly of medium to dark grey and olive grey claystone with occasional and minor limestone and dolomite stringers. The unit is firm, blocky to amorphous, micromicaceous, having traces of glauconite and pyrite and tuffaceous material. (Early Coniacian  Late Santonian, Late Cretaceous) This interval consists mainly of medium to dark grey to medium grey/brown, and occasionally olive grey claystone, with several minor micro- and cryptocrystalline limestone stringers and one thin micro-crystalline to crystalline dolomite stringer. (Early Coniacian, Late Cretaceous) The 21m (TVT) thick Lysing Formation shows an upward increase in grain-size from claystones to medium grained sandstones. The top and the base of the of the Lysing Formation equals the top and the base of the gross sandstone interval. The top is easily recognised on the top of 1m thick carbonate cemented sandstone bed. The base of the Lysing Formation has gamma ray, density and velocity increase and neutron porosity decrease going down and out of the sand into the claystone. The spiky increase in gamma ray to some 230-250 API units below base Lysing Formation (in the Lange Fm) probably represents sequence boundary marking the base of depositional sequence where Lysing Formation is included in the upper half. With regard to lithofacies, however, this belongs to the Lange Fm. Thin sections show relatively clean sandstones intercalated with detrital clay laminae. Based on the abundance of these detrital clay laminae, wackes and arenites have been recognised. Some lithic grains, dominantly mudstone intraclasts are abundant in two of the thin sections (25%). One sample contained 18.3% kaolinite and, hence, is classified as kaolinitic. The diagenetic history of the the Lysing sandstone is characterised by at least two periods of grain dissolution and abundant kaolinite cementation, interrupted by pulse of quartz cementation which apparently predates compaction and protected remaining porosity from the same. The kaolinite crystals appear relatively fresh, with no evidence of illitisation. Only mica- and feldspar-replacive clast decay illitization (2%) has occurred as opposed to grain-rimming illitization. Abundant but patchy replacive and porefilling dolomite, and local poikilotopic porefilling calcite cementation followed the later period of secondary porosity development.', 'Passage_id': 551}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The abundance of detrital clay laminae and combination of abundant kaolinite and carbonate cementation, together with minor compaction effects controlled the Lysing reservoir quality. The kaolinite cement contains significant micro-porosity, as do the detrital clay laminae. Thus, much of the measured Helium porosity comprises poorly permeable micro-porosity. Quartz cementation is generally sparse, but in two samples it is sufficient to have protected earlier porosity from compaction. However, compaction is not significant factor in the low to moderate reservoir quality of these samples, which is primarily controlled by the abundant cement. (Mid - Late Turonian, Late Cretaceous) The Lange Formation consists mainly of medium to dark grey claystones, being firm to moderately hard, sub-blocky to blocky, splintery to sub-fissile and micromicaceous. Some 32 thin stringers of micro- and cryptocrystalline limestone are evenly distributed all over the Lange Fm. Traces of siltstone and sandstone have been reported from the cuttings in the upper 100m of the formation. TD was reached at 3667 (3637)m within the Lange Fm. No Lange sands were identified on the logs.', 'Passage_id': 552}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: End of Well Report 3. Geology, Geophysics and Petrophysics 3.3 Geochemistry The phenols and the organic acids as reported in the Lysing MDT samples indicate that the water has been in contact with hydrocarbon accumulation at an earlier stage. No other routine geochemistry studies were undertaken in this well, as no source rocks were penetrated and no hydrocarbon bearing zones were encountered/sampled.', 'Passage_id': 553}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6506/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 3.4 Geophysics Acoustic logs Wireline sonic (ISONIC) and density logs were recorded in open hole section for both the Tertiary and the Cretaceous target levels. Both P-sonic and S-sonic logs were acquired. The quality of the logs across both target levels is very good, but the S-sonic log is suffering from poor registrations in the interval below Top Springar Fm. However, the poor data quality section does not interfere with any of the targets for well 6506/3-1. VSP/Checkshot Survey A zero offset VSP for well 6506/3-1 was acquired by READ Well Services. The survey ranged from 3664m to 950m MD RKB. The result of the study is presented in separate report. The report describes the Zero Offset VSP data acquisition and processing, sonic calibration and generation of synthetic seismograms for well 6506/3-1. The receiver array consisted of satellites, each containing component geophone cartridge. Thus, levels were acquired simultaneously. The geophone spacing was 20m. The spacing between registration levels in the hole was 10m from 3664m to 1270m MDRKB, apart from few levels of spacing, and 20m from 1270m to 950m MDRKB. The seismic source employed was 150 cubic inch sleeve gun, located at 3.5m depth and with an air capacity of 1800psi. A checkshot list was computed from the first arrival values and survey geometry. Based on the checkshot values the P-sonic was calibrated to real time values. Seismic Calibration Apart from the calibration presented in the Zero offset VSP report, an independent calibration was performed applying SynTool as the software. See Figures 3.4-1 to 3.4-4. The outcome of this effort is presented in this report. The sonic calibration is based on the checkshot data generated from the Zero Offset VSP. The display is according to normal SEG convention, with increase in acoustic impedance represented as peak. The wavelets used to convolve the reflection series from the well are extracted from DTW2000 in 500ms time window at the Tertiary and Cretaceous target levels. The synthetic trace for both the Tertiary and Cretaceous display panels are compared with seismic traces and lines from 3D DTW2000 nearest to the penetration point for the well at the two levels. For the Tertiary the best fit parameters and the tie as displayed in Figure 3.4-1 are all very good. The DTW2000 survey has to be shifted 12ms downwards to give the best possible match to the synthetic seismogram. This shift is in accordance with the results reported from the Zero Offset Report by READ. The tie points can be read directly from the displays in Figures 3.4-1 and 3.4-3.

The only significant sand interval was the Lysing sand. The interval was evaluated with core, wireline logs, and sidewall core. Fluid samples were retrieved from the formation and the analysis of those samples indicated the sands to be water bearing. The log data quality across the Lysing sands is excellent and no noticeable wellbore effects are present. Log data quality throughout the Cretaceous is good. However, significant washouts in the Upper Cretaceous from 2115 to 2400 have adversely affected density, neutron and shear sonic data. No attempt has been made to repair this data as the section where the washout occurred is of little relevance to the analysis of the well. Log Analysis The analysis of the Lysing sand is presented in Figure 3.5.2-1 and Table 3.5.2-1. The analysis was performed as follows:  Vsh was calculated using GR.  Density porosity was calculated using RHOMA of 2.66g/cc and RHOFL of g/cc (Versavert base oil).  Density porosity was shale corrected to give PHIE  Rw was measured from the MDT water samples and temperature corrected to  Sw was calculated using the Archie equation with a, and values of 1, and respectively.  Net sand was determined using an effective porosity cutoff of 12%. The log analysis results indicate the presence of hydrocarbon with high Sw at the very top of the Lysing sand. Bed boundary effects caused by the high resistivity calcite stringer immediately above the Lysing sand are thought to cause this. This agrees with the MDT water samples that contained no free gas and, when restored to down hole conditions, were undersaturated with gas. The three MPSR water samples were analysed by Petrotech to determine the composition of the formation water. Sub-samples of the recovered water were sent to the University of Bergen (UiB) to determine if organic acids and phenols were present. The data from UiB and Petrotech was analysed by Dewpoint AS to determine if the water was in contact with hydrocarbon. The analysis report from Dewpoint AS can be stuided in the Appendix.

Geology, Geophysics and Petrophysics 3.5.3 Formation Evaluation  Tertiary The Brygge, Tare and 37m of the Tang Formation contained total of 140.5m (Measured Thickness) of diatomaceous material and volcanics. Sand reservoirs were not encountered. SEM and XRD results show diatomite to be the dominant lithofacies in this interval with some component of volcanic glass. The Opal to Opal CT transformation has only partly taken place at the base of the unit. The unit was water filled and significantly over-pressured. The interval was evaluated with wireline logs, cuttings and sidewall cores. The log data quality across the interval is excellent with wellbore effects are only apparent from 1630m to 1655m MDRKB. The wireline data is presented in Figure 3.5.3-1. The scales on the density and the neutron porosity logs are to g/cc and to respectively. Pressure data was recorded across the interval and showed significant overpressure of SG. The gradient indicated fluid density of g/cc. The pressure data is presented in Figure 3.5.3-2. No fluid samples were retrieved from the formation although fluid samples were attempted. The cause of the failure to acquire fluid samples was the formation collapsing around the MDT probe. Drawdown pressures after short pumping time were high and increasing indicating probe plugging or lack of connected reservoir porosity. Hydrocarbon migration through the formation can only be inferred from the gas log data, which indicate significant amount of methane present when the formation back-flowed at 1698 m. Due to the complex makeup of the formation matrix, no significant attempt was made to evaluate the porosity. simple density porosity calculation using an assumed grain density of 2.25 g/cc and fluid density of g/cc (Versavert base oil) gave an average porosity of 38% for the interval. There is no net reservoir in the interval.

Tow to Location With the last anchor bolstered, the rig went under the tow of the Far Fosna for the 91 nautical mile journey to the Donna West location. It was accompanied by two anchor handling vessels: the Normand Progress and the Normand Jarl. Average speed was ~4 knots. However, after 21 hrs under tow the weather and sea state deteriorated (32 knot winds and 3m seas) and the decision was taken to go to survival draft (18.3m). This was completed within hrs. The rig was towed the remaining nautical miles to the Donna West location and held just off station pending an improvement on the weather for running anchors. Forecasts issued midday on the 20 July suggested an imminent improvement in the weather. At 16:30 hrs the decision was made to de-ballast the rig back to towing draft. This was completed in hrs and by 23:00 hrs the sea state had improved sufficiently to work anchors. Prior to, and during the tow, ModuSpec carried out full BOP inspection. No significant problems were found with the exception of one cracked 5 ram block. replacement set of rams were sourced and flown to the rig for installation prior to running the stack. Running Anchors The rig was Run in on Line at 23:00 hrs 20 July and anchor handling started with #5 pennant being handed to the Normand Progress at 01:00 on the 21 July.

An excess of 200% was used. wiper dart was released through TIW valve and the cement displaced with the cement unit at m3/min to leave 5m of cement above the shoe. Final displacement pressure was 10 bar at m3/min. Cement returns were seen at the mudline while observing with the ROV.

All damaged centralizers were removed with others being relocated to result in the casing string configuration shown in Fig. 2. This string was run in hole with the ROV providing continuous visual watch. The casing was filled with s.g. inhibited KCl mud while running in hole from 450 to 1374m. It was washed down from 1335 to 1379m with 3000 lpm. casing swedge was used. The casing was cemented as per program using 100% open hole excess. Good returns were seen with ROV throughout the entire cement job. At theoretical strokes the 13.3/8 cement plug had not bumped and the displacement halted.

It had been held at s.g for formation evaluation purposes but was then increased to 1.50s.g. and planned to go to s.g. by 1900m. Well Control Incident at 1698m During connection at 1698m, an increase in pit volume was noted. The well was shut in using the Upper Annular. The SICP was 200 psi and 4m3 pit gain was recorded. The float was bumped to obtain the SIDP of 300 psi. An additional 0.5m3 of mud was bled off through the choke but the casing pressure remained at 200 psi. It was decided at this point to begin circulating out the influx via the Drillers Method of well control. The maximum gas at bottoms up was 4.6% and no other contaminants could be identified at this time. The final background gas was 2% and with the well shut in the SICP was 150 psi and the SIDP 200 psi. Trapped pressure was bled down and the casing and drill pipe pressure remained at psi over 45 minutes while the riser was displaced to SG mud. To minimize the possibility of stack gas it was decided to close the Lower Annular and attempt to reduce the pressure on the Upper Annular. However, on the Byford Dolphin single regulator controls both Upper and Lower Annulars and so when attempting to reduce the pressure on the Upper Annular both annulars relaxed resulting in second influx being taken into the wellbore. An incremental pit gain of m3 was recorded. The well was shut in on the Lower Annular and the SICP built to 150 psi. An attempt to bump the float in the string failed, with the drill pipe pressure increasing to 420 psi with no resultant change in casing pressure seen. This was repeated several times with no success, indicating that there was an obstruction somewhere between the drill pipe and choke. The well was isolated and the surface choke, kill and choke lines were flushed to clear obstructions, probably caused by cuttings settling out in the choke line. The well was then shut-in on the Lower Annular and opened back to the choke line and flow checked for 10 minutes with the choke line open to the trip tank. The well was static. The well was then opened up and the pipe moved. No flow was observed. Rotation was established at 120 rpm, 5500 N.m torque. However, when starting to pump slowly with 260 lpm, 500 psi, the flow rate was seen to increase and further pit gain noted. Rotation was stopped and the Lower Annular closed. SICP was 250 psi and the incremental pit gain m3. While the mud in the pits was weighted up to SG the casing pressure increased from 250 to 290 psi. The well was displaced to SG mud with 485 lpm, 600 psi. The influx was circulated out, recording maximum gas of 8.9% and lowest mud weight of SG. Salt water contamination was identified in the mud. The mud was circulated and conditioned for full system volume with maximum gas peak of 1.7% observed on the last bottoms up.

The bit was graded 3, 5, CT, A, X, IN, BT, CP with several cutters being broken. The bottom string stabiliser was also scarred and piece was missing from one of the blades. Using LT-OBM, no cuttings could be discharged to the sea in this hole section. The Swaco cuttings collection system, involving vacuum pumps, drop off tanks and weighting scales were used to collect all the cuttings. No major problems were experienced.

Coring Operations The 8.1/2 Coring assembly listed below was made up and run in hole: 8.1/2 DBS FC274 Corehead 75.78m of Stabilized Core Barrel Eight outer core barrels, totaling 76m in outer length, complete with inner core barrels that allowed up to 73m recoverable core length were run. During the trip in hole it became necessary to wash and ream from 1405 to 1417m and from 2150 to 2319m. lot of cuttings / cavings were seen over the shakers. The final section from 3040 to 3101m was also washed down before circulating bottoms up. The maximum gas seen during this circulation was 6.8% and corresponded to ~2450m. The interval from to 3171.5m was cored with 1050 lpm, 129 bar, 100 rpm, 5000  10,000 N.m torque. The additions of sacks per hour of calcium carbonate continued through this cored interval. At 3171.5m the torque dropped back to steady 6000 Nm and slight pressure drop was seen, indicating that core had jammed. The assy. was pumped out of the hole from this depth to 3069m. bottoms up was then circulated. During the trip out of hole it was necessary to work the pipe from 1583 to 1430m with maximum overpull of 9MT. No further problems were encountered.

Run #3 - Back-up PEX (Weak Point  ECRD  8000 lbs) After analysing the data from Run #1, the density tool was seen to be reading unusually low through the Brygge and Tare formations (between 1828m and 1624m). It was decided to re- log this section with the back up Density, Neutron (PEX) toolstring. This Run #3 (2000 to 1590m) was completed in hrs 55 mins and was seen to repeat with the previous PEX run, Run #1. Run #4 - Read Level VSP (Weak Point  Yellow  4800 to 5400 lbs) The Read level Delta VSP tool was made up and run in hole on the Schlumberger line. It stood up at 2060m but was freed with 2000 lbs overpull and worked through to bottom. However, two attempts to correlate the toolstring on depth failed due to sticking, the first requiring 3000 lbs overpull to free. On the second attempt the tool became stuck at ~3403m (top geophone depth) for 45 mins. The toolstring was eventually freed by working it with up to 7000 lbs line pull (normal logging tension - 3400 lbs & toolstring weight - 900 lbs). While pulling out from this depth, additional overpulls were experienced and the toolstring became stuck again at approximately 3090m (top geophone depth). It was immediately worked to maximum line pull of 7000 lbs but without success. The air gun array was fired and the signal monitored on the geophones in an attempt to determine where the toolstring was stuck. After being stuck for hrs 50 mins the string freed itself while holding 7000 lbs line pull.

It was run in hole without difficulties with check shots being taken at 1280m, 2400m & 3200m (wireline depth). The tool string was correlated over the Lysing to the AIT- PEX-HNGS run of the 10th August 2001 and run down to tag TD. The VSP survey was recorded at 10m intervals from 3523m to 2898m (wireline top geophone depth). At 2898m, the walkaway survey was conducted. With the walkaway completed, the survey continued, again at 10m intervals from 2898m to the final station at 790m. No hole problems or overpulls were encountered throughout the survey.

Inclination:  It was evident that the initial load out of oil based mud was contaminated with 18 m3 (a figure derived from calculating the volume of water addition required to change the Oil/Water ratio from that notified to the rig) of water from the boats tanks. Consequently the Oil/Water ratio started of at 68/32. It was therefore necessary to make up 50 m3 of base oil premix to correct this, in addition it was also necessary to substantially increase the water phase salinity with powdered calcium chloride. While drilling at depth of 1675 metres the mud weight was being increased from 1.45 sg to sg (with plan to later raise it to sg). At 1698 metres with the active and half of the annulus at density of sg an influx of m3 into the well bore was experienced. The equivalent mud weight required to circulate out the influx was also sg. The system was maintained at this weight for full circulation. Influx returns at surface were routed to an empty pit and the system weight was maintained at sg. At this time additional mud volume was weighted up to sg to replace the diverted volume and to provide buffer against any losses. It was then observed that there still remained 80 to 90 psi on the drill pipe. The mud weight was raised to 1.57 sg, which was deemed sufficient to kill the well. The 13 3/8 casing contents were treated with an enhanced premix plus calcium chloride whilst weighting up. total of 10 12 m3 formation brine was incorporated into the mud. The riser was displaced using the booster pump to mud that had been previously treated with emulsifiers, calcium chloride and then weighted up. This created mud, which was in good enough condition to run back into the hole. The hole was circulated bottoms-up and problem-free wiper trip was conducted to the shoe. Static seepage losses of m3 per hour were observed on running back to bottom. These losses were attributed to the Brygge sand. Similar dynamic losses were observed whilst drilling ahead but they were cured using an initial treatment of 0.6kg/m3 of Coarse and Medium Calcium Carbonate. The concentration was M-I NORGE A.S.

The petrophysical model and the general evaluation method is given in appendix C, whereas well specific comments to the evaluation are given in this section. The evaluation was solely performed using PetroWorks software. 1 Input Data Environmentally corrected wireline curves were received from Schlumberger and these curves where used for evaluation purposes with the exception of the gamma-ray curve. In order to obtain a gamma ray curve which is consistent with the reference gamma ray curve (6507/7-4) , the Schlumberger borehole corrected gamma curve was normalised by procedure described in Appendix C. In the 12  hole section the CDN phase resistivity was taken as the deep resistivity due to lack of wireline laterolog data in this well. The logs used as input to the evaluation were: gamma ray (GR), density (RHOB), neutron porosity (NPHI), and deep resistivity (RD). An overview of curve nomenclature is given in Appendix D. 1 Processing The petrophysical evaluation has mainly been performed according to the standard evaluation method given in appendix C. Comments and evaluation methods which deviates from this are described below Shale volume The shale volume curve VSH is in this well solely based on the density-neutron method. Permeability The permeability curve KLOGH is in this well is based on new method. This method is briefly described in Appendix C.

A clear GOC could not be observed from the gas effect on the Neutron and Density logs. These logs could only show that there is gas down to 2302 TVDSS. Below this depth, effects of shale are canceling the gas effect and prevents identification of the GOC. For this well, the compressional slowness log DT seems to be more useful. By comparing with other wells with and without gas in Tilje 1.1, the DT log in the lowermost sand in this zone indicates that the GOC is as deep as 2320 TVDSS.

Petrophysical results The CPI plots together with the raw logs for 30/9-F-5 and F-5 are presented in Figure A-4, and Figure A-5 respectively. Table A-6 presents the average petrophysical results of the CPI result from the two wells. The CPI result from F-5 gives oil saturation in the interpreted water zone. This is interpreted as result of thin-bedded lithology, shoulder effects, and due limited vertical resolution of the tools giving averaging of the measurements. It can also be result of petrophysical method that overestimates the porosity, and underestimates the water saturation in silty lithology. In the average petrophysical results these interpreted erroneous oil fillings below the OWC are edited, and water saturation set to (100%). MDT pressures were recorded in 30/9-F-5 to quantify the formation pressure, expected as initial pressure due to F-5 being the first producer on the G-st structure, and to establish fluid-gradients and -contacts. Operations/Quality The MDT log was correlated to the Baker Hughes Inteq Gamma Ray Log. No depth shifts has been performed on the MDT data, except the shifts done by the logging company. The MDT tool was conveyed on drill pipe. The tool was set 31 times resulting in 22 good to very good tests, tight/dry samples. 30 samples were taken on downlog, and on uplog. Pressures were gathered from Lower Heather Regression (LH_REGR), Upper Tarbert, MT2-3 and MT1-2.

Preparations for drilling the 24 hole section was started, however, due to an ongoing labour conflict the drilling of the section was postponed from 12:00 hrs July 11th 2002 until 23:00 hrs August 11th 2002. Drilled 24 hole from 281 m. Kicked off at 306 and drilled and oriented down to 1729 where the string twisted off. The bit and motor with x-over on top were left in the hole. The fish was engaged and fished out of the hole in the second attempt. Five bit runs were used to drill the section from 281 to1998 m. The reasons for pull- ing the bits were; MWD failure, penetration rate, steering problems and twist off. The inclination was built from 00 to 690 and azimuth turned from 1700 to 250. Gyro surveys were run until the gyro survey and MWD survey correlated. The 28 conductor shoe and new formation were drilled with seawater and high viscous pills before displacing to sg Bentonite mud. wipertrip was performed be- fore entering the Utsira formation. The hole was displaced to sg Glydril mud after drilling the Utsira formation. The mud weight was increased to1.26 sg at 1530 and to 1.30 sg at TD of the hole section. The hole was in good condition when pulling out after drilling to TD of section. The 18 5/8 casing was run and cemented with 246 m3 sg lead slurry and m3 1.92 sg tail slurry. Due to losses the return on the wellhead was opened during the dis- placement of cement. The casing was tested to 70 bar.', 'Passage_id': 589}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-F-5 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: B-5 1.5 1/2 Hole Section Total depth of section: 6410 mMD / mTVD Tagged the landing collar at 5971 and drilled hard cement to 6020 m.

After an IBC-CBL run, one XPT-Ora-NGI tool string was deployed in the same section from the 19th to 21st of November 2019. This section was drilled with Oil Based Mud (OBM). The MDT run (Run 1D) was performed to conduct InSitu Stress Testing by using single-mandrel Packer module (Frac- 12K) for fracture initiation, and Dual Packer (MRPA) module for hydraulic stress testing with an extended interval of 1.6 module. The Frac-12K module was configured above the MRPA module to initiate fracture with Sleeve Fracturing technique (initiating formation breakdown with one specially designed single packer element). The Frac-12K element is 0.61 long. 3025.8m MD (station file no.7 & 8) 3076.5m MD (station file no.5 & 6) 3122.5m MD (station file no.2 & 3) The XPT-Ora run (Run 1G) was performed to obtain formation pressures, acquire formation fluid samples and conduct Interval Pressure Transient Test (IPTT). The tool string includes one XPT large-diameter probe (LDP), Formation Communicator Radial Focused (FCRF) and two FTNG Flow Manager (FNFM). Fluid InSitu Sample Optimizer (FISO) was used for fluid identification. Pressures were evaluated from MD to MD. Nine (9) samples were acquired during the run: two (2) water samples at MD (Ora station file no.4) and seven (7) oil-water-mixture samples at MD (Ora station file no.2). IPTT was also performed at MD (Ora station file no.2). Permanent datum is mean sea level. All Wireline depth measurements were referenced to the drill floor which was located above mean sea level. Depths for all stations were correlated with Run 1A AIT-PEX-HNGS-GR log dated 16th of November 2019. Pretests Interpretation Summary Formation pressure was evaluated at 21 stations. Pretests were attempted in different modes (commingle, sample inlet only, and guard inlet only) in two Ora stations. Hence total of 25 pretests are presented in this report. All pretests were processed and evaluated using InSitu Pro software. For the 19 XPT stations, only data from the quartz gauge was used for interpretation, although the strain gauge compared well. For the two Ora stations, only data from quartz gauge was used for interpretation of commingling pretests and sample inlet pretests, and only data from strain gauge was available and used for interpretation of guard inlet pretests.

The well was landed in the 4Ccd sand as prognosed. The quality of this sand was better than most of the J-2 area wells drilled to date. A zonation of the three horizontal sections is made difficult by the faulted nature of the dome structure which characterises the J2-template area. The interpretation of the horizontal sections has therefore been based on an estimate of the vertical displacement of the faults from seismic. In this way the long m-sand interval in Y1H (top at 2390m MD RKB) and the first long m-sand interval penetrated in Y1HT2 (top at 281Orn MD RKB) are both attributed to the juxtaposition of 4Cm against 4Bm sand. Similarly the c-sand interval penetrated at the centre of the structure is interpreted to be composite sequence of 4Bc and 4Ac sand. Numerous calcite stringers were penetrated in both branches and in the sidetrack. In the Y2H branch one of these stringers (3070-3077m MD RKB) knocked the wellpath down by 1.4m TVD, resulting in hours of reaming. 3.2 Lithostratigraphic subdivision The depth and thickness of the reservoir layers within the Sognefjord Formation penetrated in the build-up and horizontal sections are presented in Tables A-1-A3. The geological cross sections in Figures A-3a, and A-3b and A3-c illustrate the actual wellpath plotted on locally updated geological model.

Grain size analyses data are reported on files at the end of this report. SEDIMITTOLOGY . We examined two cores from 95891 to 96781, wich are in the upper part of the reservoir rock. The reservoir is made of sand stone beds few meters thick interbedded with thin clay layers rich in fine sand. The cleaner sands are in the upper part of the reser voir. Sandstone beds are mostly massive but the finer sandstones have parallel or wavy laminations. Bioturbation is often present in shaly intervals. Clay fragments are frequent both in sand stone and in clay beds. There are also structures that can be at tributed, in spite of the small size of the cores available, to slumpings. These indicate &certain sediments instability during the deposition (growing structure ?) (Encl. 1, Photos). Grain size analyses show that sands never have medians -coarser than 200 microns; the -coarser grains instead arrive to millimeters. Medium sands were mostly transported as graded suspen stone, fractions coarser than 700-800 microns were transported by rolling.

PETROGRAPHY Quartz sandstones, light grey, poorly sorted with clay matrix, silica and carbonate cements. Generally carbonate cement is irregular ly distributed (Enic1.1).Maior components of the detrital fraction are:  subrounded quartz grains sometimes cataclastic  scarce, weathered: feldspars, mostly represented by acid plagio clase  mica flakes in subparallel laminations  very rare detrital glauconitic grains. Grain contacts are mostly tangential, sometimes planar. POROSITY AND PERMEABILITY The porosity values in sandstones range bet,reen 15 and 25%. Permeability is nearly always between 10 and 100 md (Encl. 1). This range of porosity is quite high for medium cemented sandstones as they are; this is due to the low percentages of car bonate and silica cements. Peimeability instead is not very high in relation to the grain size of the sandstones. In fact these sandstones have certain percentage of matrix and poor sorting that keep permeability at relatively low Values. Probably silica and carbonate cement have no strong influence on the permeability; Pressure solution effect is also negligeable as contacts between grains are mostly tangential..', 'Passage_id': 618}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: CHAPTER Summary This report contains the results of detailed sedimentological and petrographic study of the extensively cored Jurassic interval in well 6507/5-4, in the Skarv area, offshore Mid Norway. The well was drilled by BP Norge in early 2001 and represents the third well in the PL212 Licence to penetrate the Jurassic reservoir interval. The well, like the previous 6507/5-1 (RRI Report No. 8150/Id, 1998) and 6507/5-2 (RRI Report No. 8321/Id) wells, has been drilled on western terrace of the Nordland Ridge, prominent NNE-SSW trending basement ridge that continues northwards into the Lofoten Ridge (Caselli, 1987; Blystad et al., 1995) and south into series of terraces (including the Halten Terrace) that generally plunge towards the south and southwest. The 6507/5-4 well is located on the C segment to the south of both 6507/5-1 (RRI Report No. 8150/Id) and 6507/5-2 (RRI Report No. 8321/Id). Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rifting to the west of the Nordland Ridge resulted in footwall uplift and consequent erosion of the older Jurassic sediments and the ridge commonly has very thin and incomplete covering of Jurassic sediments. The newly drilled 6507/5-4 well is located in broadly similar structural setting to the 6507/5-1 well. The results of this study strongly suggest that thinning is the result of depositional condensing as opposed to truncation or faulting. The primary aims of this study are to provide detailed description and interpretation of the depositional environments and reservoir characteristics of the Lower and Middle Jurassic interval in well 6507/5-4, including detailed description of the available cores (Cores 1-4; Garn - Tilje Formations). The 6507/5-4 well contains Jurassic interval which is superficially very similar to that encountered in the previous Skarv wells, and contains wide range of depositional facies, ranging from fully non- marine sediments in lower parts of the re Formation (uncored) to relatively deep water, open marine mudstones in the Melke and Spekk Formations. All of the constituent formations of the Jurassic recognised in the previous wells, and more generally in the Mid Norway area, are clearly recognised in the study well. The encountered facies are broadly comparable to those in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and the facies analysis, documented in Chapter of this report, makes reference to these previous studies (RRI Report Nos. 8150/Id and 8321/Id). The Jurassic interval in the PL212 Licence records gradual, but punctuated, overall transgression: non-marine sediments are locally present in lower parts (re Formation); locally sand-prone marginal marine deposits in the overlying Lower to Middle Jurassic; and mudstone-dominated, open marine facies in the Upper Jurassic. It is, however, important to stress that the Early to Middle Jurassic does not record period of passive or continuous subsidence and that sedimentation and subsidence were highly punctuated. This interpretation is further supported by the evidence from the Page', 'Passage_id': 619}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id new 6507/5-4 well. brief summary of the depositional setting of each of the main constituent formations is outlined below, highlighting new information derived from the cored interval in 6507/5-4. Spekk Formation Deep water, offshore mudstones deposited during regional sea level highstand. Not cored in Melke Formation Shelfal to outer shelf, fully marine mudstones deposited in water depths significantly below storm wave base and deposited during regional sea level highstand. Not cored in 6507/5-4. Garn Formation Tidal sandwave sediments deposited in fully marine environment but with relatively shallow water depths. The Garn Formation represents complex series of large scale, compound tidal bars and associated tidal channels with local protected intra-sandwave areas. There is good evidence for genetic link between the progradational shoreface sediments of the underlying Not Formation and the marine sandwave sediments of the Garn Formation and the marine origin of the Garn Formation is very well constrained by combination of facies characteristics and ichnofabrics (trace fossil assemblages). The top Garn surface is uncored in the 6507/5-4 well, but the Garn is completely cored below 3512.5m dd. case can be made for the base Garn surface representing transgressive surface of erosion (TSE) that was associated with marked change in basin physiography. Not Formation A fully marine sequence of mudstones and sandstones displaying very well developed and progressively shallowing upwards transition from relatively deep water, offshore shelfal sediments near the base to very shallow water, shoreface sediments towards the top. There is good evidence for a transitional passage into the tidal sandwave sediments of the overlying Garn Formation. Ile Formation In common with the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, the new well contains distal (offshore) facies of the Ile Formation which is in marked in contrast to the Ile Formation seen in the Heidrun and Smrbukk areas. In the PL212 Licence, the Ile Formation consists predominantly of series of moderately to intensely bioturbated, argillaceous sandstones deposited in an open marine, shelfal setting with no direct evidence of attachment to contemporaneous shoreface. Ror Formation The Ror Formation is completely cored in the 6507/5-4 well and consists of sequence of moderately to intensely bioturbated, sandy mudstones and highly argillaceous, very fine grained sandstones, deposited in fully marine, outer shelf setting in water depths largely below storm wave base. The high abundance and high diversity of the trace fossil assemblage is indicative of climax (or equilibrium) community dominated by infaunal deposit feeding organisms. Relative variations in sedimentation rate are tentatively recognised based on the overprinting of organisms occupying different tiers (burrowing depths) in the original sediment. Progradational packages are tentatively identified within the Ror Formation and upper parts are significantly more heterogeneous than lower and middle parts, locally containing hiatal surfaces and condensed sections marked by glauconitic, sideritic and chamositic sandstones including tightly cemented oolitic sandstone. The constituent units of the Ror Formation and the condensed sections can be correlated with confidence between the', 'Passage_id': 620}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Tilje Formation A complex and highly heterogeneous sequence of interbedded sandstones and lesser mudstones deposited primarily in marginal marine, coastal to deltaic setting with episodic incursions of fully marine waters. In general, the Tilje Formation represents the deposits of low relief, marginal marine coastline consisting of complex of variably restricted and typically tidally dominated bays and lagoons, fed by small tidal channel and mouthbar complexes, which eventually passed into relatively low energy, shallow marine basin. general observation is that fully marine and strongly marine influenced environments are better represented in the Skarv area than in areas further to the south. This is broadly in keeping with regional trends established in earlier studies (RRI Report Nos. EM079, EM129). distinctive, and genetically discrete unit of relatively coarse grained sandstone occurs at the top of the Tilje Formation in 6507/5-4. This unit is correlated to similar sequence in 6507/5-1, which is absent in 6507/5-2. Biostratigraphic evidence suggests this unit might be Toarcian in age. re Formation The re Formation is not cored in the 6507/5-4 well but, based on interpretation of the available wireline logs and comparison with the 6507/5-1 well, where upper parts of the re Formation were cored, it is expected to contain the deposits of large scale, restricted, marginal marine bays or lagoons and associated shallow tidal flats. Lower parts of the re Formation are expected to be dominated by non-marine facies including fluvial channel, crevasse splay and mouthbar sandstones with interbedded overbank mudstones and coals. In summary, the Lower to Middle Jurassic interval in well 6507/5-4 is well developed and broadly comparable to that in 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2. It is general observation that relative to more southerly parts of the Halten Terrace, the Lower to Middle Jurassic in the PL212 Licence represents a more distal facies of many of the main units. This pattern is particularly evident in the Ile and Tilje Formations and broadly supports the regional mapping interpretations carried out as part of regional Lower to Middle Jurassic reservoir studies (RRI, 1997, 1999). 1.3 PETROGRAPHY AND DIAGENESIS Lange Formation The SWC samples are poorly to well sorted, very fine to medium grained, lithic, sublithic and subarkosic arenites. Although the main detrital mineral is quartz, ductile components such as detrital mud, mica and plant fragments are common in some samples. Calcareous bioclasts and glauconite are also present. The main diagenetic minerals are ferroan calcite, which is mainly pore filling, and kaolinite and siderite, which have replaced and expanded mica grains. Moderate compaction has also destroyed porosity. Porosity is mainly primary and intergranular in origin and tends to be most abundant in clean, little cemented, medium grained sandstones. Reservoir quality is very variable but is commonly poor because of the very fine textures, high ductile content and locally abundant ferroan calcite cement. The Garn Formation sandstones are moderately compacted, poorly to well sorted, fine to very coarse but mainly medium grained, lithic to sublithic arenites in which detrital clay abundance is generally minor. The main detrital grain type is quartz. Subordinate feldspars have been partly leached. Ductile components are generally scarce except near the base of the formation.', 'Passage_id': 621}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Diagenetic modification is moderate and is less than in the other Jurassic formations. However, kaolinite is locally abundant (max. 15.32%) and has detrimental effect on reservoir quality. Chlorite is rare to absent in the Garn Formation. Pore networks are dominated by primary intergranular macropores supplemented by subordinate grain dissolution pores. The pores are typically well connected, hence permeabilities are high and the Garn has the best reservoir properties of all the Jurassic formations. The sandstone samples of the Not Formation comprise very fine and fine grained, typically well sorted, mainly sublithic arenites which have detrital mineralogy dominated by quartz. Ductile components, most notably mica (max. 11.33%), are abundant in the lower part of the formation. Diagenetic modification is locally pronounced and the main diagenetic mineral is kaolinite (mean 13.41%). This commonly replaces mica grains and has reduced reservoir quality. Other authigenic minerals include siderite, quartz overgrowths and ferroan dolomite. Because the sandstones are relatively fine grained and rich in ductiles, pore networks tend to be mixed to micropore dominated and the extra fine macropores tend to be poorly connected. The petrographic samples are mainly very fine and well sorted, though the formation as whole is texturally highly variable. The detrital mineralogy is dominated by quartz, with subordinate feldspars and lithic grains. Ductile components are generally minor, though clay ooids and peloids are locally notable. Diagenetic modification has been moderate to severe and the main secondary components are quartz overgrowths (mean 7.93%), indeterminate, probably illitic clays, siderite and ferroan dolomite. Pore networks tend to be dominated by micropores with macropores tending to be poorly connected in these relatively argillaceous and fine grained sandstones. The single petrographic sample analysed is an argillaceous, sideritic, very fine grained, sublithic arenite which is bioturbated and moderately sorted. It has very poor reservoir properties. Most of the petrographic samples are fine grained sublithic arenites which are poorly to well sorted. Quartz dominates the framework mineralogy and ductile components are generally rare although detrital mud (max. 4.66%) and, in upper parts, glauconite peloids and ooids are locally present. Diagenetic modification has been moderate to severe and the main authigenic minerals are kaolinite (mean 6.35%, mainly filling primary pores) and siderite (max. 27.99%, commonly replacing detrital mud). Pore networks tend to contain roughly equal amounts of microporosity and macroporosity. The macropores tend to be moderately to poorly connected, partly because significant proportion of the macropores are of secondary, grain dissolution origin.', 'Passage_id': 622}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 1.4 RESERVOIR GEOLOGY The Garn Formation and uppermost Not Formation represent the primary reservoir in the 6507/5-4 well. good visible oil stain was observed in the core with probable gas cap in the upper part of the Garn. The cored interval of the Garn Formation in 6507/5-4 has mean porosity of 17.89%, with a relatively low standard deviation of 2.41, but has wide range of permeability values with maximum of 9870 mD and minimum of mD. The arithmetic mean permeability is 1739.33 mD, with slightly lower geometric mean permeability of mD, and relatively high standard deviation of highlighting the variability in measured horizontal permeabilities. Cross plotting of the core analysis porosity against permeability values reveals only weak positive correlation. There is moderate relationship between reservoir quality and both facies and grain size. Reservoir quality is influenced by variations in the abundance of kaolinite, the main authigenic mineral. Although quartz overgrowth cement has reduced porosity, it does not appear to control variations in reservoir quality. The cored interval of the Tilje Formation is in the water leg and has poor to only rarely moderate reservoir quality. In view of the broad similarity in terms of depositional character between the Tilje Formation between Skarv wells, diagenetic influence on this reduction in reservoir quality needs to be considered. The Tilje Formation has mean measured porosity of 16.01%, with standard deviation of 0.35, and limited range of permeability values with minimum of mD and maximum of 1290 mD. The arithmetic mean permeability is mD, with geometric mean permeability of only mD, and standard deviation of 198.33, highlighting the variability in measured horizontal permeabilities. Cross plotting of the core analysis porosity against permeability values reveals positive correlation and there is good relationship between reservoir quality and both facies and grain size. Authigenic kaolinite has significant deleterious effect on reservoir quality. Other authigenic minerals have also reduced reservoir quality, as has compaction, which is likely to be most important in the less well sorted and ductile-rich sandstones. significant proportion of the macroporosity in the Tilje is of secondary, grain dissolution origin and secondary porosity tends to be common in sandstones rich in detrital albite and lithic grains. The reservoir geology of the remaining Jurassic succession is variable but is generally lower than that in either the Garn or Tilje Formation. Moderately good quality sandstones occur in the upper part of the Not Formation whereas much poorer quality is prevalent in the micaceous, very fine sandstones in the lower part of the formation. The micaceous sandstones also tend to be rich in kaolinite and carbonate cements. The Ile Formation is sand prone relative to the enclosing Ror and Not Formations but is particularly thin and condensed in the 6507/5-4 well. The highly bioturbated and typically argillaceous nature of these sandstones results in generally poor reservoir quality. 1.5 ZONATION AND CORRELATION The Lower to Middle Jurassic sediments examined in the study well contain complete succession of the constituent formations recognised in earlier wells (6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2) which penetrated this interval in the Skarv area (see RRI Reports Nos. 8150/Id and 8321/Id, respectively). As result of regional work in the Mid Norway area, Robertson erected broadly chronostratigraphic zonation scheme for the entire Lower to Middle Jurassic which was defined in The Lower to Middle Jurassic reservoirs of Mid Norway study (RRI Report No. EM079, 1997). This zonation scheme has been extended into the 6507/5-4 well as part of this report, the zones being given the appropriate suffixes (e.g. Tilje 1, Ror 4, etc.). All of the constituent zones are recognised in the present study well although, in common with the successions in these earlier wells, subdivision of the Melke Formation is difficult and the usable wireline log data terminate in the upper part of the re Formation, making correlations below this depth impossible.', 'Passage_id': 623}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A definition and description of each zone are given in Chapter of the current report, which also places these units within their sequence stratigraphic context. Detailed correlation of the succession in earlier wells is dealt with in separate report (RRI Report No. 8337/Id, 2000), but the conclusions drawn from the application of the zonation and correlation scheme to the current study well, based on the findings of this report, can be summarised as follows:  Evidence for an Aalenian (?Aalenian - lower Bajocian) mudstone interval (Zone Not 3) overlying the Garn Formation in this part of Mid Norway is improved by data from the 6507/5-4 well. The presence of this mudstone helps to constrain the age of the underlying Garn Formation.  The Garn Formation is notably thick in the 6507/5-4 well (c. 57m). new reservoir subzone (JS13.9) has been recognised at the top of the Garn Zone. This new subzone consists of distinctive, high dip angle, cross bedded sands deposited in sandwave crest environment, underlain by slightly finer sands deposited in sandwave flank environment.  The base Garn Formation surface has previously been interpreted as forced regression rather than sequence boundary. Although this remains reasonable, an alternative interpretation could define the base Garn surface as transgressive surface of erosion (TSE) associated with deepening event. In either case it is considered inappropriate to interpret the base Garn surface as sequence boundary.  The Ile Formation in well 6507/5-4 is significantly thin. This thinning may be attributed to reduced subsidence in the 6507/5-4 well area. However, despite these changes in total thickness, the overall character of the Ile Formation is similar for all Skarv wells, representing deposition in relatively extensive shelfal sand environments (dominated by Facies EA5a) separated by erosive transgressive lags which are easily correlatable across the Skarv study area.  The Tilje Formation in 6507/5-4 is notably different in some parts compared with other Skarv wells. The most significant differences occur at the top and base of the Tilje Formation in well 6507/5-4. The uncored base of the formation in this well (basal Tilje and Reservoir Zones JS2.1/2.3) consists of very thin (<1m thick) unit which is interpreted from wireline log responses to be composed of restricted marginal marine or lagoon bay shoreface sands. This interval is severely attenuated. The overlying section (upper Tilje 1) represents background sedimentation in more extensive shelfal or transitional environments. The top of the Tilje Formation (Tilje 6, Reservoir Zone JS6.8) is also disproportionately thick in 6507/5-4. It consists of distinctive, poorly sorted and glauconitic subtidal channel and shoal sediments (Facies EA1 and EA2) which overlie thin, repetitive lagoonal and tidal flat sediments of Reservoir Zone JS6.4. Reservoir Zone JS6.6 appears to have completely eroded. Biostratigraphic data (RRI Report No. 6255/Ia) suggest that this interval may be Toarcian in age and it is certainly texturally and sedimentologically distinct. JS6.8/Tilje is consequently interpreted to be genetically separate unit from the underlying parts of the Tilje Formation.', 'Passage_id': 624}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Well 6507/5-4, Sedimentology, Petrography and Reservoir Geology CHAPTER Introduction This report documents the results of detailed sedimentological study of the Jurassic sediments encountered in BP Norge well 6507/5-4, offshore Mid Norway, focused primarily on the cored interval of the Tilje to Garn Formations. The report has been prepared at the request of, and in consultation with, BP Norge AS and the aims, database and methodology are briefly detailed below. The main part of the study consists of detailed description and facies analysis of the cored interval, supplemented by petrographic analysis of selected sandstone samples. consideration of the geological controls on variations in reservoir quality is undertaken. The report builds on previous work from study of the equivalent interval in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells (RRI Report Nos. 8150/Id and 8321/Id respectively). To avoid repetition, the discussion of facies analysis, reservoir quality and zonation focused on variations from those encountered in the previous studies. 2.1 AIMS The primary aim of the study was to produce detailed, high quality core description of the Jurassic interval in well 6507/5-4, leading to production of sedimentological/reservoir geological study, specifically to provide clear understanding of the facies distribution, characteristics and reservoir quality of the Jurassic section. In addition, it was an aim of the study to address the following points:  Lateral reservoir distribution (thickness and facies) in areas adjacent to the well.  The location and continuity of potential production barriers.  brief comparison of reservoir quality between the 6507/5-1, 6507/5-2 and 6507/5-4 wells. 2.2 DATABASE In order to meet the study objectives, the following data were made available by BP Norge:  All available conventional cores from well 6507/5-4, with description based on the slabbed and resinated (B) cut.  Digital data consisting of suite of standard wireline log data, core gamma, core analysis and digital core images.  Core photographs for well 6507/5-4. The following data were provided for the petrographic analysis:  Plug offcuts and/or core chips sufficient for routine thin-section preparation, SEM and XRD whole-rock and clay-fraction analysis of the cored Jurassic interval.

The results and interpretation of the XRD data for this interval was undertaken by X-Ray Minerals directly for BP Norge, but is included as part of this report for completeness.  Routine core analysis data for both the Jurassic and the Cretaceous intervals. 2.3 METHODOLOGY The report represents compilation of the main results of core description and reservoir geological study undertaken by Robertson Research International Ltd. Results from all phases have been integrated into the report summary and into the discussion of reservoir quality. An outline methodology relating to the core description and facies analysis is presented below and more detailed methodologies are included as appropriate in the appendices. Core Studies Four (4) cores were recovered in the 6507/5-4 well, detailed in Appendix 2, and cover the entire interval from the upper part of the Garn Formation to the middle of the Tilje Formation. The cores were described in detail from the slabbed and resinated B cut stored at Corepro in Stavanger, Norway during May 2001. Detailed sedimentological core description was undertaken at scale of 1:50 and included description of lithology, grain size, primary and secondary sedimentary structures, biogenic structures, macrodiagenetic features, accessory minerals, hydrocarbon shows and palaeoenvironmental interpretation. Colours were recorded using standard Munsell colour chart, primarily on dry rock. Copies of the original hand drafted 1:50 scale core descriptions were passed to BP immediately on completion of the core description phase of the study. The original core description was partially digitised using WellCADTM software and Robertson data dictionaries, and is presented as series of 1:50 scale core description charts (Enclosures to 3). The core description was subsequently redrawn and re-scaled to 1:200 for correlation with wireline log and core analysis data. Facies Analysis The facies scheme adopted in this report is based on scheme developed for two regional studies of the Lower to Middle Jurassic reservoirs of Mid Norway (RRI, 1997, 1999), allowing integration of the results from the present study with other data sets, and is consistent with that utilised in the core study of the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells (RRI Report Nos. 8150/Id and 8321/Id respectively). full description of the facies scheme is included as Appendix to this report and is summarised in Table 3.1. Discussion of the facies analysis in the present report focuses on changes and modifications to that reported previously, and reference should be made to these reports for more complete justification of facies interpretations. For the uncored parts of the Jurassic succession, the facies interpretation is based on the available wireline log data, constrained by regional considerations which rely on detailed reservoir zonation and correlation with the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells. For intervals uncored in any of the PL212 wells, data from RRI regional studies have been used.', 'Passage_id': 626}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Petrographic Analysis Petrographic analysis of selected samples from the 6507/5-4 well was undertaken by RRI resulting in a fully integrated report considering all geological influences on reservoir quality. The thin sections were prepared by RRI and XRD analysis was conducted by Steve Jones of X-Ray Minerals. Details of the petrographical techniques used during the course of this study are presented as Appendix 4. Every effort has been made to ensure consistency with the modal categories used in previous studies (BP Amoco, 1999; RRI, 1997; RRI Report No. 8321/Id). As result, the raw petrographic data have been normalised to include modal porosity, and it is recalculated data which are presented and used in this report. 2.4 REPORT FORMAT This chapter forms general introduction to the report. The results and conclusions of the study are briefly summarised in Chapter 1, which also includes brief answer to specific questions raised by BP, and more fully discussed in Chapters 3-5. These chapters cross reference with enclosures, figures, plates and appendices where necessary and are supplemented by text figures and tables, which are presented at the end of each chapter. 1:50 and 1:200 scale core summary charts are included as Enclosures 1-3 and Enclosure respectively, with 1:500 scale data summary chart included as Enclosure 5.

Stratigraphic Note In common with previous reservoir geological studies in the Skarv area, the stratigraphic subdivision of the study interval has utilised two separate zonation schemes. The first scheme (Tilje 1, Tilje etc.), which is displayed on the data summary charts and referred to within the text, is derived directly from regional reservoir studies of the Lower to Middle Jurassic undertaken by RRI (RRI, 1997, 1999). This zonation scheme is based on the correlation, facies analysis and biostratigraphy of in excess of 100 wells in the Mid Norway area and is chronostratigraphic in nature. In view of the regional nature of this scheme, the selected surfaces do not necessarily correspond to the most obvious breaks in the succession as encountered in the Skarv area. The second zonation scheme is local in nature and was initially erected, in conjunction with BP (formerly Amoco Norway Oil Company), for study of the 6507/5-1 well. This scheme has zones and subzones with the JS prescript and was amended and enhanced during study of the 6507/5-2 well. Major formation boundaries and most other major surfaces of the RRI regional scheme are recognised as zone or subzone surfaces in the detailed reservoir zonation scheme. The zonation of the study interval is discussed in more detail in Chapter but is noted here to avoid confusion when referred to below. 3.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter addresses the facies analysis and depositional modelling of the cored Jurassic succession encountered in well 6507/5-4, consisting of most of the interval from the upper part of the Garn Formation to the middle of the Tilje Formation. The cores were described in detail at scale of 1:50 and the core descriptions are given in Enclosures to 3. These core descriptions form the basis for the facies analysis and interpretations detailed below. The Jurassic in the 6507/5-4 well includes sediments deposited in wide range of marine to non-marine environments, and the facies analysis is discussed separately on formational basis. The facies scheme is, however, intended for application to all parts of the Jurassic and is outlined below and documented in Appendix 3. Reporting in the present study is focused on describing variations and differences from the adjacent 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, and reference should be made to these preceding reports for an extended discussion of facies interpretations (RRI Report Nos. 8150/Id and 8321/Id). 3.2 FACIES SCHEME The facies scheme adopted for the present study represents global facies scheme developed by Robertson, and is based primarily on examination of very large amount of core in the northern North Sea and offshore Mid Norway areas. wide variety of depositional facies have been Page 10', 'Passage_id': 628}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: recognised, which can be divided into four broad groupings based on depositional setting. These facies groups are further subdivided into constituent facies and subfacies, representing increasingly specific depositional environments. Each facies represents distinct association of lithology, grain size profile and sedimentary structures, which relate directly to the processes of deposition and can be used to interpret depositional environment. The facies scheme is consequently genetic, rather than descriptive, scheme. The individual facies are discrete bodies of rock deposited in response to definable circumstances and consequently have specific geometrical and textural characteristics relating to their reservoir properties. The individual facies therefore form the architectural components of any potential reservoir. The individual facies are represented by series of facies codes (Table 3.1) that are included on the 1:50 and 1:200 scale data summary charts (Enclosures 1-4) and are listed in the study database and described in Appendix to this report. It is important to stress the hierarchical nature of the facies scheme that should allow for up scaling of the interpretations. The adopted facies scheme is the same as that used in recent Robertson multiclient reports in the Mid Norway area (RRI, 1997, 1999) and with that used in the core study of the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, allowing full integration of the results presented here with previous studies. This facies scheme is outlined in Table and in more detail in Appendix of this report. The sediments encountered in this study were deposited in paralic, nearshore and marine shelf/platform environments. These settings have been coded as C, D and E respectively, with codes beginning in the letters A and B reserved for fully continental sediments and codes F upwards for more distal marine environments. Within the settings relevant to the present study, four broad facies groupings are recognised:  Alluvial/Delta Plain CA  Lagoonal/Estuarine CB  Nearshore, Siliciclastic DA  Marine Shelf and Platform, Siliciclastic EA Alluvial/delta plain sediments (Facies Group CA) represent relatively proximal subdivision within the paralic setting and pass both distally and laterally into lagoonal and/or estuarine sediments (Facies Group CB). Fully marine environments are represented by groups DA and EA, the former representing generally higher energy, nearshore environments and the latter more distal settings. The individual facies are coded according to this scheme, with more proximal facies generally existing higher in the structure. The relative spatial distribution of these groups is schematically illustrated in Figure 3.1. The adoption of single, genetic facies scheme allows for consistency in facies interpretations and codings and aids comparison between wells. The specific characteristics of each facies can, however, be defined separately for each formation and/or well allowing high degree of flexibility in the usage. fluvial sandstone in the Ile Formation, for example, may be quite different from fluvial sandstone in the Tilje Formation. In addition, there may be an occasional need to use more detailed or more descriptive lithofacies scheme to extract greater degree of the observed variation than the established scheme allows (e.g. 6507/6-2 study; RRI Report No. 7963/Id). In each case, however, these lithofacies or descriptive facies schemes can be linked back to the global genetic facies scheme. As part of the initial core study of the 6507/5-1 well, ANOC requested application of Statoil lithostratigraphic scheme to code the Tilje Formation. For variety of reasons, the scheme was not found to be particularly useful in describing either the observed variation or in helping with genetic Page 11', 'Passage_id': 629}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: interpretations, although the concept of lithofacies scheme for the Tilje Formation was thought to be valid. For these reasons, descriptive lithofacies scheme was constructed specifically for the Tilje Formation of the 6507/5-1 well and subsequently applied to the relevant cored intervals in well 6507/5-2. The same scheme has been applied to the cored Tilje Formation in the 6507/5-4 well and can be used for comparison. Both the genetic and lithofacies breakdowns are included in digital format on the study CD ROM. The following sections briefly discuss the facies characteristics of the Jurassic interval of well 6507/5-4, on formation-by-formation basis, and lead to an interpretation of the depositional systems responsible for their accumulation. The likely lateral extent of specific reservoir units is discussed briefly both within this section and in Chapters and 6. As mentioned above, this section forms an addition to that presented as part of the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 core studies (RRI Report Nos. 8150/Id and 8337/Id) and reference should be made to these reports for more detailed descriptions of the constituent facies. The discussion below is consequently focused on features of the 6507/5-4 well which differ from those previously described for other Skarv wells. 3.3 ICHNOFABRIC ANALYSIS Trace fossils are described as an integral part of the main facies scheme and are consequently included in the descriptions and discussions included below, rather than forming separate section of the report. It is, however, clear that the abundance and variety of trace fossils in the cored interval provides the potential for more detailed study of the trace fossils. full, quantitative ichnofabric analysis would be required to extract the maximum information from the cored sections and such an analysis was not within the scope of this project. The trace fossil analysis included in this study is closely integrated with the facies analysis and the traces are used as an aid to the characterisation and interpretation of individual facies. The specific trace fossil data included in the report are briefly outlined below. During the core description phase of this study, the intensity of bioturbation was recorded as moving line at scale of 1:50. This scale is comparable to the bioturbation index (BI) that is commonly recorded as part of quantitative ichnofabric analyses and is given on scale of (unbioturbated) to (completely bioturbated or homogenised). For brief discussion of the concept of bioturbation index see Pemberton et al. (1992). In addition to the intensity of bioturbation, individual traces were identified as part of the core description and are included as graphical representation on the resultant core description charts (Enclosures 1-3), which provide summary of the suite of trace fossils occurring in any part of the cored interval. For legend of the symbols used to represent individual trace fossils see Appendix (standard legend). The trace fossils recognised within the core occur in distinct assemblages and have definable inter- relationships that relate to the mode of life of the trace makers, the depth of burrowing, the nature of the substrate and variety of environmental conditions. These features can be used to identify distinctive ichnofabrics which are defined as those aspects of the texture and internal structure of sediment resulting from all phases of bioturbation (Martin, 1993) and ichnofabric analysis as the study of the texture and internal structures of sediment that result from bioturbation (animal reworking) and bioerosion at any scale (Martin, 1993). For practical purposes the ichnofabric elements of the present study are fully integrated with the genetic facies scheme and it is considered appropriate to combine and integrate the trace fossil analysis with the facies analysis, rather than to duplicate the description and interpretation of the sedimentary sequences. It is, however, evident that distinctive suites of trace fossils can be recognised in the cored intervals that overlap facies Page 12', 'Passage_id': 630}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: boundaries or occur within single facies unit. For this reason, an informal ichnofabric scheme has been applied to the entire cored section that consists primarily of record of the association of the most distinctive trace fossil assemblages. The resultant ichnofabrics are shown on the 1:50 scale core description chart as series of codes and the tops and bases of these intervals are included on the study database in the table ICHNOFABRIC. These divisions have further aided the facies analysis with which they are fully integrated. The facies breakdown of all of the formations is presented in Table as well as within the corresponding sub-chapter. 3.4 FACIES ANALYSIS BY FORMATION 3.4.1 Garn Formation In general terms, the Garn Formation in the 6507/5-4 well is similar to that encountered in the previous Skarv wells, being dominated by relatively clean, medium grained cross bedded sandstones deposited in shallow, marginal marine setting as complex series of large scale tidal sandwaves. The following facies were encountered in the Garn Formation of the 6507/5-4 well and the corresponding reservoir qualities of each facies within the Garn Formation is presented in Table 3.3. GARN FORMATION FACIES_ID Facies Thickness (m) % Count CB1c Tidal sandwave crest 16 CB1d Tidal sandwave flank/minor sandwave CB1e Minor intra-sandwave channel 10 CB1f Inter-sandwave tidal channel CB1g Inter-sandwave/inter-shoal trough Total 43 The dominant facies in the Garn Formation clearly consists of tidal sandwave crest sediments of Facies CB1c, with combined thickness of nearly 22m accounting for more than 40% of the cored interval. Finer grained sandstones of Facies CB1d, interpreted as minor sandwaves and sandwave flank sediments, are also common, as are minor intra-sandwave channel sediments of Facies CB1e. Coarser grained inter-sandwave tidal channel sediments of Facies CB1f are relatively rare in the 6507/5-4 well, as are the fine grained inter-sandwave trough sediments of Facies CB1g. The facies sequence in the Garn Formation is very similar to that recognised in the previous Skarv wells and similar interpretation is indicated. The sandstones of Facies CB1c were deposited as compound series of stacked, relatively small scale, sinuous- to slightly sinuous-crested bedforms best described as megaripples and small dunes with an average bedform height in the region of 50 cm-1m (Figure 3.2). The preserved bedforms are believed to have formed part of larger scale compound barforms with common reactivation surfaces generated by repeated reworking and truncation. The marine character of these sandstones in the 6507/5-4 well is confirmed by the presence of Skolithos and ?Palaeophycus traces (e.g. at ~3518m dd), together with other more tentative traces, and the generation of relatively high energy, unidirectional currents in marine environment is most likely to be accomplished by tidal processes. Facies CB1d in the study well consists of sediments which are broadly similar to those of Facies CB1c but are generally finer grained and may be marginally more argillaceous and bioturbated (Figure 3.3). This facies is believed to have developed as either minor, relatively small-scale tidal sandwaves or as facies developed on the flanks of larger sandwaves, the crestal parts of which are Page 13', 'Passage_id': 631}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id represented by Facies CB1c. Minor intra-sandwave channel sediments of Facies CB1e form significant component of the Garn Formation in the study well, although this facies was considered relatively rare in the 6507/5-2 well (Figure 3.4). In general terms, Facies CB1e is similar to Facies CB1c but is characterised by slightly poorer sorting, locally common granules and outsized sand grains and relatively abundant carbonaceous debris. characteristic feature of intervals ascribed to Facies CB1e in the 6507/5-4 well is weakly developed fining upwards grain size profile, from medium upper to coarse lower at the base through to medium lower towards the top. Individual units of this facies are typically 1-2m thick. Facies CB1e is most common in upper parts of the Garn Formation, in the interval ascribed to Zone Garn and is most commonly interbedded with cleaner sediments of Facies CB1c. Facies CB1f is particularly rare in the 6507/5-4 well but occurs at similar stratigraphic level to intervals with the greatest concentration of this facies in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells. As in these other wells, this facies represents the highest energy Garn facies and is interpreted to have been formed within channels developed in the troughs between large-scale tidal sandwaves. Rare intervals of Facies CB1g represent the finest grained, lowest energy facies within the Garn Formation and are typically the most bioturbated intervals (Figure 3.4). This facies is interpreted as the deposits of relatively sheltered parts of the sandwave environment, probably in protected inter-sandwave or inter-shoal troughs, and may also have developed in response to abandonment of part of the sandwave system. Despite the general similarity of the Garn Formation to that described in the previous Skarv wells, number of features encountered in the 6507/5-4 well have not been observed in these earlier wells. In particular these include well-developed unit of clean sandstone towards the top of the Garn interval (3538.28m-3542.7m; essentially in the middle of the Garn Formation). This unit is characterised by very well defined, high angle foreset surfaces with very consistent dip direction. The interval is in excess of 4.5m thick and contains particularly thick individual foreset laminae which are locally inverse graded. The measured dip angle on the slabbed core surface is in excess of the theoretical maximum angle of repose for medium grained sandstones, probably as result of minor fomation (structural) dip, and the surfaces are interpreted as angle of repose grainflow foreset laminae. Given the preserved thickness of some of these foreset laminae (commonly in the region of 10mm and up to 25 mm orthogonal thickness) and the apparently consistent dip orientation throughout 4.5m thick unit, an original bedform height in excess of 5m is implied, probably as part of large scale tidal sandwave. There is tentative evidence for the development of tidal bundle sequences associated with variations in foreset laminae thickness and mud-drape development and some foreset laminae show minor bioturbation. Although interpreted as major tidal sandwave facies, and consequently ascribed to Facies CB1c, this unit contains features that appear to be otherwise rare in the Garn Formation. somewhat similar facies was encountered towards the base of tidal sandwave unit encountered in the upper part of the Not Formation of the 6507/5-2 well. In this case the coarse grained sandstone interval was interpreted as near-complete tidal sandwave and a similar interpretation could be applied in the 6507/5-4 well. Two other minor facies were also encountered within the Garn Formation of 6507/5-4, consisting of a thin but distinctive interval of extremely garnetiferous sandstone (3551.4m dd) and 4cm thick mudstone unit (3544m dd). Garnet-rich sandstones have been previously described from the Garn Formation in the greater Skarv area (e.g. well 6507/3-3, RRI Report No. 8337/Id), although the sandstone in the present well is remarkably rich in garnet. The presence of an apparently in situ unit of mudstone within the Garn Formation is particularly rare occurrence and the interval has been sampled for biostratigraphic analysis. Deposition of mud within the depositional environment envisaged for the Garn Formation is not thought unusual, but such fine grained sediments are considered to have particularly low preservation potential in setting characterised by relatively Page 14', 'Passage_id': 632}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: high energy process and repeated reworking. There may be particular significance to the preservation of this mudstone in the interval immediately underlying the high angle dipping foresets described above. possible interpretation could be that the interval records unit characterised by relatively high accommodation potential, either as result of the infilling of depositional topography or minor change in relative base level. A relatively detailed depositional model for the Garn Formation has been presented previously as part of studies on the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells. The new data derived from the 6507/5-4 well does not require any major revisions to these previous models. In brief, the Garn Formation in the study well contains combination of features which strongly suggest marine depositional environment, including suite of marginal marine trace fossils and an organisation of bedding structures, best interpreted in the context of marine tidal sandwave setting. conceptual model is presented in Figure 3.5. The marine character of the Garn Formation is considered unequivocal. Palynological and micropalaeontological evidence from in situ argillaceous material within the Garn Formation of several wells in the Mid Norway area is strongly suggestive of marine origin (RRI, 1997, 1999; Saether et al., 1999) and both the primary sedimentary structures and preserved ichnofabrics strongly support this interpretation. Alternative interpretations of the Garn Formation as fluvial sandbody (Harris, 1989), partly fluvial sandbody (Ehrenberg et al., 1992) or fan deltaic unit (Gjelberg et al., 1987), are largely rejected. The sandstones of the Garn Formation were deposited by migrating bedforms developed in response to relatively high energy flows and represent large compound barforms. The currents which deposited these barforms were essentially unidirectional (rather than oscillatory) in character. Limited palaeocurrent data from core goniometry in the 6507/5-2 well suggested dominant current direction towards the ENE with subordinate current towards the south or southwest. reversed northwesterly palaeocurrent is suggested in well 6507/5-4 for the upper parts of the Garn Formation (Zone Garn 2). In the lower parts of the Garn Formation, palaeocurrents appear to have been from the west, even, slightly from the WSW. At 3525m dd there is good evidence of flow reversal due to tidal currents. The generation of high energy unidirectional currents in relatively shallow water, near shore marine setting is most easily accomplished by tidal processes. The largely unidirectional nature of the palaeocurrent data indicates an asymmetry of the tidal wave at individual well locations and further suggests that the ebb and flood currents were not of equal strength, feature which is common in most modern tidal settings (Nio et al., 1980; Dalrymple et al., 1990; Nio and Yang, 1991). In common with the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, the vertical sequence of the Garn Formation in 6507/5-4 is complex. The lower part of the Garn forms well developed coarsening upwards sequence (Reservoir Zone JS12), with relatively distal minor sandwave, sandwave flank and inter- sandwave trough sediments in lower parts passing upwards into well-structured sandwave crest sediments. This pattern may be associated with the initial establishment of large scale sandwave system and is capped by inter sandwave channel sediments representing the coarsest grained sediments within the Garn. The coarsening upwards sequence is relatively abruptly overlain by better sorted sandwave crest sediments of Reservoir Zone JS13 with slightly finer grained, more heterogeneous sequence at the base (JS13.3) and more homogeneous upper part (JS13.7). Although poorly structured, these sandstones are not truly massive and the poor preservation of tractional structures is at least in part associated with bioturbation. Uniquely in the Skarv area, the 6507/5-4 well contains distinctive unit of high angle dipping sandwave sediments above the more massive poorly structured sandstones. This sequence is capped by very sharp surface, associated with an abrupt decrease in sorting and increase in carbonaceous (coaly) fragments. This surface is believed to correlate with the coal encountered in 6507/5-2 and marks distinctive stratal surface, which may have developed during relative lowering of sea level. Above this level the Garn Page 15', 'Passage_id': 633}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Formation has markedly different character which is associated with change in colour and return to better structured sandwave flank and minor sandwave sediments. In summary, the Garn Formation in the Skarv area is interpreted as an internally complex sequence of large coalesced tidal sandwaves. The unit bears comparison with the sandridge systems described by Dalrymple (1999), tidal shields of Nio et al. (1980), and the Nantucket Shoals area of the present day North Atlantic (Swift et al., 1981), with processes similar to those operating in the modern Gironde estuary (Berne et al., 1993). Dalrymple (1999) suggests that sandridge systems most commonly develop in transgressive systems tracts on low accommodation shelves. Such an interpretation is considered particularly relevant for the Garn Formation in the Skarv area. The base Garn Formation surface is interpreted as transgressive surface of erosion (TSE) associated with an increase in energy when well-connected tidal seaway was established in the mid Norway area. 3.4.2 Not Formation The Not Formation is entirely cored in the 6507/5-4 well and occurs in the lower parts of Core 2. The top of the Not Formation is placed at core depth of 3564.42m dd where there is an abrupt contact between more argillaceous and bioturbated sediments of the Not Formation below and cleaner, coarser, less bioturbated sediments of the Garn Formation above. The base of the Not Formation is picked at core depth of 3598.95m dd. In common with the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, this basal surface represents transitional passage from the underlying Ile Formation. The following section deals specifically with the facies encountered within the Not Formation, focused on variations from the facies analysis presented as part of the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 core studies. Representative core images of the facies encountered within the Not Formation are included in Figures and 3.7. In the broadest sense, the Not Formation represents progradational to aggradational sequence of shelfal to shoreface sediments, which records gradual, progressive shallowing upwards at the site of the 6507/5-4 well. The facies encountered in the Not Formation of the study well are briefly summarised below: NOT FORMATION DA5a Foreshore DA5b Beachface DA5e Longshore/Nearshore trough DA6 Lower to middle shoreface DA6a Wave dominated lower to middle shoreface DA6b Storm dominated lower to middle shoreface DA6c Mixed lower to middle shoreface DA7 Offshore transition zone EA5a Sand dominated bioturbated shelf EA5b Mud dominated bioturbated shelf Total 39 The dominant facies within the Not Formation is DA6a, wave dominated lower to middle shoreface, with thickness of 8.75m, accounting for 25% of the newly cored interval. An almost equally abundant facies within the Not Formation is EA5a, sand dominated bioturbated shelf. This facies represents 18% of the cored interval with combined thickness of 6.28m. Subordinate to these two facies is mud dominated bioturbated shelfal sediment, Facies EA5b, with 4.92m (14%) of the cored Page 16', 'Passage_id': 634}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: interval. Combining the two bioturbated shelfal facies illustrates that the Not Formation within well 6507/5-4 is dominated by shelfal sediment. Interestingly Facies DA5e (longshore/nearshore trough) forms significant part of the Not Formation, representing 11%, occurring solely within the upper part of the formation, reflecting the progressive shallowing upwards. On the whole the facies seen in well 6507/5-4 are similar to those seen in previous Skarv wells and similar interpretation applies. Facies DA5a occurs in the uppermost parts of the Not Formation and is characterised by cross- bedded, medium-grained, micaceous sandstone (Figure 3.6). This facies represents upper shoreface sediments developed in shallow waters subject to repeated variations in current energy associated with slack water periods. It is most likely to indicate the operation of tidal processes and relatively nearshore environment is suggested. This interpretation is further supported by the abundance of mica. Within well 6507/5-4, Facies DA5b consists of medium to coarse-grained sandstones that have a blocky grain size profile with poorly preserved internal structure relative to Facies DA5a. This facies represents sediments deposited within similar setting to Facies DA5a but with slightly higher energy. Notably the facies is also locally bioturbated with Diplocraterion. Closely associated with these two facies is Facies DA5e, longshore/nearshore trough deposits (Figure 3.3). These are characterised by precursor sediment fabric similar to that of Facies DA5b that has been subsequently intensely bioturbated. Facies DA6 represents the lower to middle shoreface and is characterised by centimetre scale bedding that is variable bioturbated with Anconichnus, Planolites and Chondrites and as result primary structure within these beds is poorly preserved. Subfacies DA6a, however, is strongly cross-stratified in the interval 3683m dd to 3678m dd, representing wave-dominated lower to middle shoreface (Figure 3.6). The generally low angle cross stratification is interpreted as hummocky cross stratification (HCS) formed in relatively high-energy system in water depths between fair weather and storm wave base. In contrast, Facies DA6b (storm dominated lower to middle shoreface sediments) is blockier with less well defined cross bedding and increased bioturbation, reflecting relative quiescence, and colonisation by benthic- and infaunal organisms. Facies DA6c represents mixture of these two facies where conditions in the shoreface environment were transitional. Facies DA7 represents the offshore transition zone and is characterised within the study well by fine-grained sandstones and mudstones that are intensely bioturbated by Anconichnus that has destroyed most primary structure. Facies DA7 is interpreted as the sediments of the offshore transition zone, marking the gradual passage from open marine shelfal sediments of Facies EA5 to more proximal sediments affected by the proximity of the shoreline. The sandstones of Facies EA5 are characterised by fine-grained sands that have little internal primary structure due to intense bioturbation by Anconichnus, Planolites, Rosselia and Teichichnus. The mudstones of this facies have similar fabric. These facies dominate the Not Formation as whole but are located largely in the lower parts of the Formation, representing relatively deep water, open marine environments, in which sands were deposited by distal storm events (EA5a, Figure 3.7). The storm events were interspersed with extended periods of relatively passive sedimentation and biogenic reworking. The Not Formation within the study well is similar to that seen in wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2. However, despite this similarity there are points of interest that are newly seen in the study well. In wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2, the ichnofabrics within the upper Not Formation were dominated by a well-established diverse ichnofauna. In contrast, within the study well the upper interval is dominated by small Diplocraterion. This trace fossil is commonly associated with restricted marine environments and the low diversity ichnofabric preserved in 6507/5-4 further supports such an interpretation. It seems likely that more restricted, environmentally stressed setting was developed at the 6507/5-4 location relative to wells in the segment. A well defined heavy mineral lag was also seen in the upper part of the Not Formation within the study well at 3566.5m dd, and photomicrograph is presented in Figure 4.6. It is this high Page 17', 'Passage_id': 635}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: concentration of heavy minerals (particularly the zircon monozite) at that causes the high gamma ray spike seen on the wire-line logs. This log may be associated with restructuration within the basin hinterland and consequent change in provenance. Within well 6507/5-2 there was section of Garn like facies within the upper part of the Not Formation. This is not seen in the study well, but coarser grained interval does occur at similar stratigraphic level and it is thought to represent the coeval flanks of sandwave similar to that seen in 6507/5-2. The implication is that the sandwave seen in well 6507/5-2 may not be unique occurrence and similar good quality sands may be present elsewhere at this stratigraphic level. A depositional model for the Not Formation has been presented previously as part of studies on the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and the new data derived from the 6507/5-4 well do not require any significant revisions to the model. conceptual model is presented in Figure 3.5. The Not Formation is very well developed in the 6507/5-4 well, with near complete succession preserved and only very limited truncation is believed to have occurred at the base of the Garn Formation. The detailed facies analysis records an almost uninterrupted, progressive shallowing upwards, from relatively deep water outer shelf setting in lowermost parts, through bioturbated open marine shelfal sediments and into progressively higher energy, shallower water and more proximal shoreface sediments in middle and upper parts. Lower parts represent sub-wave base water depths in shelfal setting passing upwards into offshore transition zone sediments. The high diversity trace fossil assemblages within the lower parts is characteristic of the Cruziana ichnofacies, and indicate normal salinity marine waters, sub fair weather wave base water depths and an unconsolidated substrate (Pemberton et al., 1992). The precursor sediment for most of this lower part of the Not consisted of storm and wave influenced shelfal sediments of Facies EA4. High nutrient levels and good oxygenation of the bottom waters, coupled to relatively low sedimentation rates, allowed near complete homogenisation of the substrate by climax community of infaunal deposit feeding organisms. Subtle variations in environmental conditions and aggradation rates can be recognised from detailed trace fossil analysis and number of discrete ichnofabrics can be recognised. The uppermost part of the Not Formation in the 6507/5-4 well was interpreted as bioturbated upper shoreface system that passed transitionally into the genetically related Garn Formation. near identical facies is present in the very uppermost part of the Not Formation in the 6507/5-2 well. Middle and lower parts of the Not Formation are very similar to the sequence encountered in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 well, representing progressively shallowing upwards sequence, thought most likely to represent progradational to (possibly) aggradational fill, although the balance between progradation and aggradation remains difficult to constrain with the presently available chronostratigraphic framework. This shoreline and shelfal system probably has fairly simple linear geometry and well-graded profile.

In common with these other wells, transitional upper contact between the Ile and overlying Not Formations is also developed in the 6507/5-4 well that is significantly more transitional than in many parts of Mid Norway. The base of the Ile Formation is picked at the base of the main sandstone dominated interval, corresponding to the base of the relatively low gamma interval. The Ile Formation has relatively distal development, dominated by intensely bioturbated shelfal sediments, and has preserved thickness intermediate between that preserved in 6507/5-1 and the very thin sequence encountered in 6507/5-2. All of the constituent zones recognised in the other PL212 wells are also present in 6507/5-4 and the formation contains the following facies: ILE FORMATION FACIES_ID Facies Thickness (m) % Count DA8 Transgessive lag EA1 Subtidal channel/shoal EA1a Subtidal channel EA1b Subtidal shoal EA4 Shelf EA4b Storm dominated shelf EA4c Mixed dominated shelf EA5a Sand dominated bioturbated shelf 13 EA6 Marine erosive lag EA7 Condensed sediments EA7a Condensed mudstones Total 30 The facies that dominates the Ile Formation in well 6507/5-4 is EA5a, representing 82% of the formation as whole, with combined thickness of 21.98m. This sand dominated bioturbated shelf sediment is prolific throughout the cored section and is only notably less abundant in the middle portion of the formation. Second to this is Facies EA4b (storm dominated shelfal sediments), which represents only 4% (or 1m of the total thickness). Facies EA5a, sand dominated bioturbated shelf sediments, represents the most prolific facies within the Ile Formation and is characterised by massive, medium-grained sandstones that are intensely bioturbated (Figure 3.8). This bioturbation has destroyed most primary structure. Facies EA5 is interpreted as the deposits of bioturbated, open marine shelfal environment. The precursor sediment is likely to have been broadly similar to the more heterogeneous sediments of Facies EA4b, consisting of thinly bedded storm emplaced sandstones. Near-normal marine salinities, well oxygenated water column and high nutrient availability are all suggested by the diverse trace fossil assemblages that were created predominantly by deposit feeding organisms. Variations in the energy level are reflected both by subtle changes in the modal grain size of the sandstones and particularly by variations in the preserved ichnofabrics. Facies EA7 and EA7a represents condensed mudstones and condensed mudstones respectively, which are characteristically highly cemented and contain floating ooids. The facies are largely moderately to intensely bioturbated with Thalassinoides, Chondrites, Siphonichnus, Anconichnus and Teichichnus and are common in the lower part of the Ile Formation representing deposition with Page 19', 'Passage_id': 637}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: virtually no detrital input when sediment remained at or near the sediment surface for some time thus allowing the development of early diagenetic cements. Facies EA6 represents only minor proportion of the Ile Formation as whole but occurs relatively frequently. This facies represents marine erosional lag deposits. These are commonly coarse-grained with numerous floating outsized grains, intra-formational pebble size clasts and rare chamositic ooids. Rarely the units preserve some primary symmetrical formsets and are also characteristically less bioturbated than surrounding sediments. Mud dominated bioturbated shelfal sediments, of Facies EA5b occurs only once within the cored interval and is intensely bioturbated with Chondrites, Siphonichnus and undifferentiated mottling. The facies overlies the transgressive lag at the top of the Ile Formation (3601.68m dd) and thus represents the temporary deepening of relative water level as result of transgression. The following facies all make up only minor part of the Ile Formation. Facies EA4, shelfal sediments, EA4b, storm dominated shelfal sediments and EA4c, mixed shelfal sediments, only locally occur within the cored interval and are essentially the same as Facies EA5 but with greater degree of primary structure preservation. Storm dominated shelfal sediments, EA4b, are crudely bedded on centimetre scale, giving rise to block grain size profile, with each bed representing storm event. Mixed shelfal sediments, EA4c, represent hybrid between storm dominated shelf and wave dominated shelf. Subtidal channel Facies EA1a, subtidal shoal sediments, EA1b and the undifferentiated facies of EA1 (subtidal channel/shoal sediments) have characteristic fining upwards grain size profiles. They are also commonly sharp based with low angle cross bedding. However, this is not always well preserved due to bioturbation by Anconichnus, Siphonichnus and undifferentiated burrows. Transgressive lag sediments of Facies DA8 are largely confined to the uppermost part of the Ile Formation where they represent transgressive events, including one which marks the onset of the Not Formation. This distinctive unit is made up of pebble and cobble sized sideritic/dolomitic sandy mudstone clasts, with loaded base. These characteristics bear comparison with similar unit seen in well 6507/5-2. The Ile Formation within the study well is similar to that seen in the two previous Skarv wells and several points are worth noting. Within wells 6507/5-1 and, to lesser extent, 6507/5-2, number of coarse grained lags were interpreted as the bedload of small, subtidal channels. However, the cored interval within the study well has further proved the lateral continuity of these units and the marked correlability between parasequences. These observations support an interpretation that these coarse grained events represent small transgressive units rather than local channels, and as result have been ascribed to the marine erosive lag facies, EA6. Within well 6507/5-1, Zone Ile is pronounced sandstone unit. In the study well, however, this unit is significantly finer grained and highly argillaceous. Recognition of this shale-out is important for identification of the top Ile pick, which in 6507/5-4 is not an obvious log pick, despite being well constrained in core. The most striking marker in the 6507/5-4 is the transgressive lag at 3601.68m dd, although correlation to the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells clearly indicates that this does not represent the top of the Ile Formation. As seen in the two previous Skarv wells, the intra-formational clasts recognised within marine erosive lags are highly cemented and look remarkably similar to in situ diagenetic patches within the Ile Formation. These intra-formational clasts represent reworked Ile Formation and the local cannibalisation of the formation in response to allocyclic changes. Page 20', 'Passage_id': 638}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A depositional model for the Ile Formation has been presented previously as part of studies on the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells which, with the minor addition of regionally extensive marine erosive lags, is presented in Figure 3.9. In the study well, in common with the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, the Ile Formation is dominated by relatively offshore, bioturbated marine shelf sediments representing distal development of this facies relative to wells further south (Heidrun and Smrbukk areas etc.). In the 6507/5-4 well, however, the Ile Formation is thin and contains abundant evidence of depositional condensing, as seen in well 6507/5-2. In comparison to the underlying Ror Formation, the Ile Formation marks an abrupt increase in energy levels associated with deposition of coarser grained, sand-dominated sediments. This change is response to decreased water depths and the advance of marginal marine shoreface system into the open marine shelf area from the west or southwest. The initial events recording this change in water depths and depositional environment occur within the uppermost interval of the Ror Formation, where distinctive interval of highly condensed sediments is developed (Reservoir Zone JS7.9). This unit can be correlated with confidence to adjacent wells and similar condensed units are present in the upper parts of the Not Formation and at the base of the Ile Formation in many areas of Mid Norway. The presence of moderately well preserved, storm dominated marine shelf deposits supports relatively shallow water setting for much of the Ile Formation and indicates at least episodically high energy depositional events. Marked variations in energy level are also indicated by the presence of marine erosion lag deposits and condensed mudstones, indicating significant periods of erosion and non-deposition. Storm events are the most likely cause of these episodic high energy and erosional events, and the preserved interval of the Ile Formation in 6507/5-4 is best described as the product of storm-dominated, shallow marine shelfal system. The thin development of the Ile Formation in the 6507/5-4 well is interpreted as depositional condensing associated with reduced subsidence in the region of the study well. All of the constituent zones of the Ile Formation initially recognised in the 6507/5-1 well are also clearly recognised in the 5-4 well, but all are thinned. The interpretation is further supported by the abundance of erosional lag deposits in the 5-4 well. This reduced accommodation space is most likely to result from reduced tectonic subsidence rather than decrease in the sediment supply rate or absolute sea level. Tectonically driven variations in subsidence rate are recorded during the early Aalenian elsewhere in the Mid Norway area, providing precedent for this process (e.g. Heidrun and Norne). No unequivocal shoreface or shoreface-related facies are recognised in the Ile Formation of the Skarv area, but the presence of relatively large scale shallowing upwards sequences suggests the operation of progradational processes and it is most likely that the Ile Formation encountered in the study well represents distal equivalent of coeval shoreface system developed towards the south or southwest of the Skarv area. Regional evidence suggests that this coeval shoreline lay some distance to the south and may not occur within the licence area. Towards the north, the Ile Formation is expected to become increasingly distal and fine grained with progressively decreasing differentiation from the underlying Ror Formation. Although the Ile and Ror Formations are locally coarse grained in areas such as Norne, there is no significant change in their environments of deposition and the coarser grained character is believed to result from marine winnowing in areas of reduced subsidence rather than proximity to palaeoshoreline. Page 21', 'Passage_id': 639}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 3.4.4 Ror Formation The Ror Formation is completely cored in the 6507/5-4 well and occurs in the lower parts of Core and the upper part of Core where it consists of fine grained, high gamma unit separating the Tilje Formation below from the Ile Formation above. Although characterised by relatively high gamma API values and negative neutron-density crossover, the Ror Formation is often dominated by sand, consisting of intensely bioturbated, highly argillaceous, very fine-grained sandstone of Facies EA5a. In general, this interval is very similar to that encountered in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and is typical of this formation in the Mid Norway area. The subtle variations in grain size and facies recognised within the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells can be recognised with confidence in the new well and relatively detailed correlation is possible despite the superficially monotonous appearance of the formation. As further point, the highly condensed interval recognised near the top of the Ror Formation is also clearly present in the study well. The following facies were encountered in the Ror Formation of 6507/5-4: ROR FORMATION EA5a Sand dominated bioturbated shelf 10 EA5b Mud dominated bioturbated shelf Total 22 The Ror Formation within the study well shows limited variety of depositional facies. The interval consists predominantly of sand dominated bioturbated shelf sediments (Facies EA5a), constituting 73% of the cored interval (38.63m). Subordinate to this is Facies EA5b, mud dominated bioturbated shelf, representing 10% (18.83m) of the core interval. The minor facies of EA7 and EA7a make up 9% of the cored interval when combined. Facies EA5a (sand dominated, bioturbated shelfal sediments) is characterised by fine-grained sandstones with little internal structure as result of intense bioturbation. The consistently high bioturbation index and resultant homogenisation of the sediment suggests relatively stable setting and the high diversity of traces is indicative of climax or equilibrium community of infaunal organisms which are typical of the Seilacherian Cruziana ichnofacies. The traces themselves are clearly indicative of marine setting and suggest deposition in normal salinity marine waters, below fair weather wave base on an unconsolidated substrate (Pemberton et al., 1992). It is most likely that storm dominated and other storm and wave influenced shelfal sediments of Facies EA4 formed the precursor sediment, although relatively low sedimentation rates (possibly associated with only limited or slow creation of accommodation space) resulted in complete bioturbation of most storm deposits. Variations in the modal grain size, the relative proportions of sand-dominated versus mud- dominated variants and in the ichnofabrics of this facies record variations in energy level and aggradation rate. In particular, it is interesting to note the presence of coarser grained interval in lower parts of the Ror Formation which is also present in the 6507/5-1 well but not in 6507/5-2. The finer-grained version of this facies is EA5b, which is essentially the same as its sandier counterpart. Facies EA7a represents condensed mudstones. These are typically highly cemented, notably by pyrite in the unit underlying the contact with the Ile Formation, and display apparently limited bioturbation. Similarly, condensed sediments of Facies EA7 are also highly cemented, with calcite, dolomite and pyrite. This facies is locally glauconitic and oolitic (Figure 3.8), and is moderately to intensely bioturbated with Thalassinoides, Chondrites, Siphonichnus, Anconichnus and Teichichnus. These facies dominate Zone Ror and the upper part of the Ror Formation and represent deposition Page 22', 'Passage_id': 640}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: with virtually no detrital input when sediment remained at or near the sediment surface for some time allowing the developed of early diagenetic cements. A depositional model for the Ror Formation has been presented previously as part of studies on the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and the new data derived from the 6507/5-4 well do not require any significant revision to the model. conceptual model is presented in Figure 3.10. The Ror Formation is dominated by fine-grained sediments deposited in relatively deep water, outer shelf environment largely below both fair weather and storm wave base. combination of sediment fabric and ichnofabric analysis allows subtle but potentially significant variations in the depositional setting to be recognised. There is clear evidence of an early Toarcian tectonic event in the Mid Norway area that resulted in rapid basin deepening, with the marginal marine sediments of the Tilje succeeded by shelfal sands and muds of the Ror Formation. This deepening event restricted coarse clastic supply to the basin margins and resulted in confinement of the sand-rich systems to the basin margins, either as result of eustatic sea level rise, reduction in sediment supply or subsidence of the basin margins. The Ror Formation appears to have been deposited during phase of relatively rapid subsidence and may thus reflect period during which the rate of creation of accommodation space outstripped the sediment supply, with the basin never filling to base level as consequence (RRI, 1999). The base of the Ror Formation rests directly on the underlying Tilje Formation with an unconformable contact. There is possibility that the uppermost sand of the Tilje Formation (Zone JS6.8) is Toarcian in age (RRI Report No. 6255/Ia), placing the major unconformity at the base of this sand. This coarse grained ?Toarcian sand may be transgressive unit and should possibly be considered as an intra-Ror Formation (Tofte) sand rather than constituent part of the Tilje Formation. Immediately above this basal unit is thin mudstone unit of probable condensed origin, above which the Ror Formation is relatively sand-rich and has weakly developed retrogradational character through Reservoir Zone JS7.1. The retrograde character culminates in deposition of the finest grained sediments of the Ror Formation in Reservoir Zone JS7.3 which are dominated by argillaceous sandstone with distal outer shelf character. Middle and upper parts of the formation contain number of weakly developed aggradational to progradational units defined by very subtle variations in grain size and by changes in the preserved ichnofabrics. These units define the reservoir zones of the Ror Formation and can be correlated over wide area. The generally stable depositional setting, that dominated during deposition of most of the Ror Formation, became more variable towards the top of the formation where there is evidence of episodic hiatal periods and consequent condensing. 3.4.5 Tilje Formation Only the upper parts of the Tilje Formation are cored in the 6507/5-4 well, occurring in the lower part of Core 4, and the top of the Tilje Formation is confidently picked at core depth of 3678.45m dd. The Tilje Formation in the 6507/5-4 well has broadly similar character to that encountered in the other Skarv wells and to other cored intervals of this formation in the Mid Norway area. The cored interval is dominated by heterogeneous sequence of thinly bedded sandstones with subordinate mudstones in upper parts and by less thinly bedded but still complex, bioturbated sediments in lower parts. The Tilje Formation in well 6507/5-4 is capped by medium-grained marine unit, which overlies more thinly interbedded heterolithic interval. This heterolithic unit has a restricted trace fossil assemblage and is broadly interpreted as tidal in origin, whereas lower parts have significantly stronger marine signature and were deposited in variety of shoreface and shelfal environments. This relatively strong marine influence during deposition contrasts to the Tilje Formation recognised in areas further to the south and it may consequently represent relatively distal development of this formation. The recognised constituent facies of the Tilje Formation are described and interpreted below, and consist of the following: Page 23', 'Passage_id': 641}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id TILJE FORMATION FACIES_ID Facies Thickness (m) % Count CB1 Tidal channel/shoal CB1a Tidal channel CB3 Tidal flat CB3a Sand-rich tidal flat CB3b Mud-rich tidal flat CB4 Lagoon/Bay shoreface CB4b Distal lagoon/bay shoreface CB4c Minor mouthbar CB5 Lagoon/Bay CB5a Sand-rich lagoon/bay CB5b Mud-rich lagoon/bay DA4a Proximal major mouthbar/ebb tidal delta DA4b Distal major mouthbar/ebb tidal delta DA5 Upper shoreface DA6 Lower to middle shoreface DA8 Transgressive lag EA1 Subtidal channel/shoal EA5 Bioturbated shelf EA5a Sand dominated bioturbated shelf Total 100 53 In addition to the genetic facies scheme described here, purely descriptive lithofacies scheme for the Tilje Formation was created during an earlier study of the 6507/5-1 well (RRI Report No. 8150/Id). This lithofacies scheme is summarised in Figure and the facies codes are presented on both the 1:50 scale core description charts (along with the genetic facies codes) and the digital data supplied with this report as the table LITHOFACIES on the study database. In contrast to the overlying Ror Formation, the Tilje Formation within the cored interval has diverse facies association. As result there is no single facies that represents more than 20% of the Tilje Formation. However, the most common facies are DA6 (lower to middle shoreface) and CB5a (sand-rich lagoon bay sediments), both representing 18%. Subordinate to these facies are EA1 and EA5a, subtidal channel/shoal sediments and sand dominated bioturbated shelf respectively. The subtidal channel/shoal facies makes up 5.96m (14%) of the cored interval, whilst the sand dominated bioturbated shelf sediments represent 4.92m (11%). It is interesting to note that Facies CB5b, mud- rich lagoon bay sediments, constitutes only 3% of the cored interval, but occurs almost as many times as Facies CB5a, sand-rich lagoon bay sediments. This difference in thickness reflects the relatively slow deposition associated with the more argillaceous facies. Other minor facies include tidal channel/shoal sediments (CB1) and bioturbated shelf sediments (EA5) reflecting the diversity of depositional settings found in the Tilje Formation. Tidal channel/shoal sediments of Facies CB1 and tidal channel sediments of Facies CB1a have distinctive fining upwards grain size profile within the cored interval, with common floating, outsized grains/pebbles (Figure 3.12). They are also characterised by sharp erosive bases. Facies CB1a is interpreted as minor tidal sandstones. This interpretation relies, in part, on the presence of the well-defined erosive bases and the fining upwards character, which is suggestive of waning flow or gradual reduction in current energy as the unit is progressively abandoned. Progressive filling (or Page 24', 'Passage_id': 642}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: lateral migration) of the channel results in abandonment and shallowing. The apparent preferential occurrence of these units at the top of minor coarsening (and ?shallowing) upwards sequences supports this interpretation, although little evidence of mud drapes was seen in core that would further support this interpretation. The genetic facies association of Facies CB3 (tidal flat sediments) includes Facies CB3a (sand-rich tidal flat sediments) and CB3b (mud-rich tidal flat sediments) (Figure 3.13). Within the study well, these facies are particularly common in middle parts of the Tilje Formation. They are characteristically heterolithic to super heterolithic, with interbedded sands and muds. The sand units commonly form lenticular formsets within Facies CB3b. Importantly, sand-rich tidal flat sediments exhibit strong tidal signature with common mud drapes and opposing foreset dip direction within superimposed beds. The facies as whole are commonly bioturbated by Diplocraterion. Facies CB3 is interpreted as the deposits of tidal flat environment, with the very shallow water nature of the setting highlighted by the well developed wave ripples, wave modification of current ripples and the presence of small shrinkage cracks (?desiccation or syneresis). The latter in particular are evidence of at least near-emergence. The trace fossil assemblages are indicative of restricted, stressed marginal marine setting. In combination, all these features are strongly suggestive of very shallow water, generally low energy marginal marine setting with sediment transport and deposition dominated by rhythmic tidal currents. Lagoon bay shoreface sediments of Facies CB4 within the cored interval are characterised by medium-grained sandstones which are locally bioturbated by Diplocraterion, with the occasional floating outsized grains/pebbles. Similarly, Facies CB4b, distal lagoon/bay shoreface sediments are medium-grained but with well preserved cross bedding and lesser degree of bioturbation. In slight contrast, Facies CB4c represents minor mouthbars within the lagoon/bay setting. These have marked coarsening upwards grain size profile and are topped by coarser unit that includes current ripples. On the whole, Facies Association CB4 represents shoreface and associated marginal marine systems developed in restricted marine bays and lagoons. Juxtaposed with lagoon/bay shoreface sediments are the lagoon bay sediments themselves. These are ascribed to three facies: Facies CB5 (lagoon/bay sediments), CB5a (sand-rich lagoon/bay sediments) and CB5b (mud-rich lagoon/bay sediments) (Figure 3.12, Figure 3.14). These facies dominate the lower middle part of the Tilje Formation in the study well. Facies CB5a consists of fine-grained sandstones that commonly have blocky grain size profile, with poorly defined, disrupted internal cross bedding. They are also bioturbated by Planolites and Skolithos. The mudstones of Facies CB5b are commonly interbedded with sandstone streaks and lenses to give very characteristic fabric. Importantly, the facies also includes shrinkage cracks (?desiccation). Facies CB5 is interpreted as the deposits of variably restricted, marginal marine bays and lagoons, an interpretation that is supported by the preserved ichnofabrics. The mud-dominated sediments of Facies CB5b represent low energy parts of these water bodies where tractional currents were rare to absent and deposition was dominated by relatively passive vertical accretion. Such conditions may represent shallow water areas that were protected from sediment supply as result of either their size or physiography. Proposed water depths for these muddy lagoon-bays are unlikely to have been greater than few metres and the presence of shrinkage cracks suggests periods of sub- aerial exposure. broadly similar setting is suggested for sandstones of Facies CB5a, with deposition in relatively shallow bodies of standing water. Relative to the mudstones of Facies CB5b these represent higher energy parts of the lagoons and bays, where tractional currents were sufficiently active to transport significant volumes of sand grade sediment. The major mouthbar sediments of Facies DA4a (proximal) and DA4b (distal) consist of fine grained sandstones with the proximal mouthbar sediments having slightly better preserved internal structures. Both facies are bioturbated by Planolites and Chondrites. Within the cored interval in well 6507/5-4 the upper shoreface sediments of Facies DA5 are fine-grained but lack any of the internal structure seen in Facies DA4a and DA4b. The single unit at 3710.5m dd is also intensely bioturbated. The facies of the lower to middle shoreface are extremely similar to the upper shoreface sediments of the Tilje Formation. Facies DA6 is common in the lower part of the Tilje Formation, reflecting the Page 25', 'Passage_id': 643}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: greater marine influence in this lower part of the interval (Figure 3.15). Transgressive sediments of Facies DA8 are only ascribed once within the Tilje Formation where they are coarse-grained with common floating outsized grains. Units of Facies DA8 recognised within the Tilje Formation typically occur at surfaces associated with abrupt changes in depositional setting and in the uppermost units are apparently associated with minor landwards shifts of facies (a relative deepening). As such, these units are best interpreted as transgressive lag deposits, although for the most part these are likely to represent only minor lags associated with local abandonment of delta elements and subsequent drowning and transgression. The top of the Tilje Formation in the study well is dominated by medium-grained sandstone with high angle cross bedding which is commonly truncated, has common floating outsized grains and shows little obvious bioturbation, although this maybe due to the poorly sorted nature of the fabric. These lithologies represent subtidal channel/shoal sediments of facies EA1 (Figure 3.14) and are often glauconitic. Bioturbated shelf sediments of Facies EA5 also record significant marine influence. Subfacies are also recognised, i.e. EA5a (sand dominated bioturbated shelf) and EA5b (mud dominated bioturbated shelf) (Figure 3.15). These facies dominate the lowermost part of the cored interval and are fine to medium-grained, intensely bioturbated with Siphonichnus, Skolithos and Asterosoma. Within the Tilje Formation, numerous potential Glossifungites ichnofacies are recorded (Figure 3.14). The Glossifungites ichnofacies represents substrate controlled assemblage of trace fossils, characterised by robust, sharp walled (locally scratch-marked), unlined, passively filled, vertical to sub-vertical domichnia, excavated into semi-consolidated (firmground) substrates. The implications of the Glossifungites ichnofacies is that it marks discontinuity surface which reflects pauses in sedimentation, generally associated with coeval erosion. Many of these discontinuity surfaces correspond to boundaries of stratigraphic significance (MacEachern et al., 1992). As result, many of the coarse-grained units from which these Glossifungites extend may have stratigraphic significance and provide valuable tool in the further refinement of the correlation of the Tilje in the Skarv area. A depositional model for the Tilje Formation has been presented previously as part of studies on the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and the new data derived from the 6507/5-4 well does not require any significant revisions to the model. conceptual model is presented in Figure 3.16. The Tilje Formation encountered in the 6507/5-4 well is in many ways similar to that in 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 and detailed interpretation is provided in the sedimentology study accompanying those reports (RRI Report No. 8150/Id and 8321/Id respectively). The Tilje Formation is interpreted as low relief, marginal marine coastal system consisting of variably restricted and tide influenced bays and lagoons, fed by small tidal channel and mouthbar complexes. This marginal marine setting passes transitionally into relatively low energy shallow marine basin towards the north. In the 6507/5-2 well, fully marine and strongly marine influenced environments were well represented in middle parts of the formation, and similar marine sediments were also encountered at this level in the 6507/5-4 well. Interestingly, and in common with many other intervals of the study well, the cored Tilje Formation interval in the 6507/5-4 well appears to be thinner than that encountered in the 6507/5-1 well with an associated change in depositional character. There is only slight evidence for any high-energy shoreface deposits, either in the study well or in the Tilje Formation more generally, and also no good evidence that the Tilje represents highly barred coastal system. In contrast, the marginal marine environment of the Tilje Formation is best interpreted as relatively low energy unbarred system (Elliot, 1986), broadly similar to the estuarine/bay complexes described by Howard and Frey (1975). The system bears comparison with deltaic systems in general and at any one location may have consisted of discrete delta, fed by coeval fluvial system that debouched into Page 26', 'Passage_id': 644}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: generally low energy marine basin at its distal termination. characteristic of the specific setting recorded by the Tilje Formation appears to be the presence of large-scale marginal marine bays and lagoons, fringed by low energy shoreface sediments and tidal flats. Much of the preserved sediments of the Tilje represent the fill sequences of these generally low energy water bodies. The classification of deltaic systems remains problematic, but the Tilje Formation would probably be best termed mixed fluvial- and tide-dominated delta (Galloway, 1975) or mouthbar-dominated shallow water delta as defined by Postma (1990). The feeder system is most likely to have represented low relief alluvial plain with channels of moderate to moderately high sinuosity, rather than an alluvial fan or fluvial fan/plains fan (Wells and Dor, 1987; Friend, 1978). In the study well, the Tilje Formation includes relatively thick interval of open marine shelfal sediments dominated by episodic storm events. These are believed to represent the deposits of the water body into which the more deltaic parts of the Tilje Formation prograded. It is interesting to note the slightly restricted nature of this marine environment, recorded by the trace fossil assemblages and generally low energy character. It is consequently possible that the marine environment into which the Tilje deltaics prograded represented large scale embayment or otherwise restricted seaway. A tidal influence for much of the finer grained lagoon/bay sediments of the Tilje Formation is strongly indicated by variety of features, including probable tidal bundles and associated rhythmically bedded heterolithic intervals (Boersma, 1969; Visser, 1980; Tessier and Gigot, 1989). It is envisaged that these intervals developed in the extensive tidal flats and restricted bay environments which dominated much of the Tilje depositional setting, and in which typically low storm activity and limited fluvial influence allowed the preservation of these relatively fine grained sediments. In view of the low relief character of the Tilje depositional system, it is envisaged that the system would have been particularly prone to rapid facies changes in response to relatively small- scale changes in external (allogenic) influences. Variations in the rate of sediment supply, small changes in absolute base level or variations in subsidence rate might all be expected to result in abrupt changes in facies at any one depositional site. In addition, the normal (autogenic) development of the Tilje depositional system is likely to have resulted in significant shifts of facies belts as channel avulsion and delta lobe abandonment moved the focus of sediment supply. In order to differentiate between allogenic and autogenic controls on the depositional system it is important to estimate the likely scale of the depositional elements within the system under consideration. For the study well this requires high-resolution correlation of available data and the integration of regional information, which is discussed further in Chapter 5. Some small-scale depositional units can be correlated with confidence between the 6507/5-4, 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and there appear to be no major changes in depositional setting. Indeed, most of the shifts in facies belts and abrupt changes in depositional setting within the Tilje Formation occur at similar level in both wells, indicating that the scale of the depositional system was significantly larger than the well spacing between the Skarv wells. In summary, the Tilje Formation is interpreted as broad, tide dominated coastal system and does not represent single or point sourced delta but an extensive, low relief coastal plain fed by numerous and probably rather small scale channels. This marginal marine environment passed distally into shallow water, marine shelf which was subject to storm activity but was generally low energy in character and may itself represent slightly restricted large scale embayment or seaway.

The smoothed nature of the fracture walls suggests non- brittle mechanism of failure, which, in turn suggests an early syn-sedimentary origin for the fracture. The sand fill also points to an early failure when the sand was still locally mobile and able to flow through the conduit.

This discussion also details the pore system make-up and reservoir quality characteristics of these sandstones, as well as their paragenesis, and is based upon SEM, XRD analyses and detailed petrographic evaluation ( see Tables to 4.7, and Enclosure 6). Note that the petrographical characteristics of these sandstones are discussed and presented by formation. The discussion is illustrated by series of photographic montages summarising the petrographical characteristics of each formation (Figures 4.1-4.13) and their paragenesis (Figure and 4.15). Note also that as the nature and morphology of the authigenic phases has been described in detail previously (RRI, 1997; RRI Report No. 8150/Id), it is not reiterated here. In order to highlight the pertinent characteristics of each formation, and thereby avoid unnecessary repetition, the structure of the subsections may vary. The petrographic data are tabulated on Enclosure 6. Reference is locally made in this chapter to specific reservoir zones, which are defined in Chapter (Section 6.5), and are illustrated on the 1:200 scale data summary chart (Enclosure 4). 4.2 LANGE FORMATION 4.2.1 Sandstone Texture and Detrital Mineralogy The samples of the Lange Formation (n=10) all come from rotary sidewall cores (MSCT) and have suffered variable amounts of damage during recovery, therefore the results, particularly macroporosities, must be treated with caution. The most damaged samples are from 3056.9m and 3071.3m. The samples are illustrated in Figures and 4.2. The samples consist mainly of moderately compacted, poorly to well sorted, very fine to medium grained, lithic, sublithic and subarkosic sandstones (Figure 4.19) in which detrital clay abundance is generally minor although one sandstone contains abundant (34.33%) mud. At the thin section scale the sandstones commonly appear laminated (Figure F, G), with strongly aligned mica and plant fragments or structureless. The sand grains are commonly subangular to angular in shape and seem in general to be more angular than those found in the Jurassic formations. Slightly sutured and concavo-convex grain contacts indicate that moderate amount of pressure solution has occurred. A sample of sideritic mudstone (3240.5m dd) was also analysed. The framework grain assemblage of the Lange sandstones is dominated by monocrystalline quartz (16%-42%, mean 33.4%), with subordinate polycrystalline quartz (2.33%-17.33%, mean 7.77%) and Page 28', 'Passage_id': 661}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: minor feldspar consisting of albite (mean 2.41%), orthoclase (mean 2.22%) and microcline (mean 4.18%). Other minor framework grains include lithic grains (principally quartzo-feldspathic, granitic grains; mean 2.81%), heavy minerals (trace-0.66%; comprising zircon, opaques, garnet, tourmaline, rutile and apatite), calcareous bioclasts (trace-1.33%), bivalves (Figure 4.1A), planktonic forams and echinoderms). The bivalve fragments commonly contain borings. The clearest differences between the detrital compositions of the Lange Formation and the Jurassic formations are the presence of skeletal grains and the greater abundance of albite in the Cretaceous unit. Ductile components are common (5.67%-41.99%) in many of the samples from the Lange Formation. They include detrital mud (0-34.33%, mean 4.18%), mica (0.33%-20.33%, mean 9.48%, mainly muscovite, mean 7.15%, Figures 4.1A, B, D, and G, 4.2A, and C), mudstone intraclasts (0-20.66% in samples, mean 2.37%), glauconite (trace-1.33%, Figures 4.1A and C) and plant debris (0-19%, mean 2.67%). Detrital mud is most abundant in the sample from 3028.9m where it supports the sand grains (Figure 4.1C). 4.2.2 Authigenic Mineralogy Diagenetic modification, particularly by ferroan calcite, kaolinite, siderite and compaction, is significant cause of degradation of reservoir quality in the Lange Formation sandstones. The authigenic mineralogy of the sandstones is dominated by ferroan calcite (0-36.68%, mean 7.11%, Figure 4.1B, and F), kaolinite (1.66%-8.32%, mean 4.66%, Figure 4.1D, 4.2A and D) and The ferroan calcite and kaolinite occur mainly in primary pores. Some of the kaolinite and siderite has replaced and expanded mica grains. Generally minor authigenic minerals include:  grain replacive indeterminate clays (0-25%), most abundant at 3225.1m where they replace mud and grains;  quartz overgrowths (0-1.66%);  pyrite (0-1.66%) which mainly replaces grains;  anatase and leucoxene (0-0.66%), which mainly replace heavy minerals;  local grain replacive chlorite and intergranular ferroan dolomite. 4.2.3 Sandstone Quality and Pore System Make-up The reservoir quality of the Lange sandstones ranges from poor to good, with helium porosities ranging from 10.5% to 26.3% and permeabililities ranging from mD to 2750 mD. The better quality sandstones (notably 3056.9m, 3071.3m and 3074.4m, Figure 4.1A) tend to be medium grained, with low amounts of detrital mud and intergranular cements. The pore networks are dominated extra fine intergranular macropores supplemented by subordinate extra fine and very fine, secondary, grain dissolution macropores. Microporosity, estimated as the difference between helium porosity and macroporosity, is relatively low, ranging from 3.18% to 5.98%. The main cause of porosity loss in such sandstones was compaction which has reduced original porosities by 11-12 Page 29', 'Passage_id': 662}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: percentage points. The presence of ductile grains such as micas and intraclasts coupled with the low abundances of overgrowth cements have aided compactional porosity destruction. The poor reservoir quality of many of the Lange sandstones is caused by several factors, notably:  very fine grain size;  high content of ductile grains, notably mica and plant fragments (Figure 4.1G);  locally abundant ferroan calcite cement. In such samples primary and secondary macropores are uncommon (locally absent) and are poorly connected. 4.3 GARN FORMATION 4.3.1 Sandstone Texture and Detrital Mineralogy The samples of the Garn Formation (n=10) comprise moderately compacted, poorly to well sorted, fine to very coarse but mainly medium grained, lithic to sublithic arenites (Figure 4.20) in which detrital clay abundance is generally minor (0-1.33%, mean 0.37%), see Figures and 4.4. The sand grains are commonly subangular to subrounded in shape. Slightly sutured and concavo-convex grain contacts and local microstylolites indicate that moderate amount of pressure solution has occurred. At the thin section scale, these sandstones commonly appear structureless although few are laminated, notably near the base of the formation. The Garn framework grain assemblage is dominated by monocrystalline quartz (40.33%-61%, mean 49.07%), with subordinate polycrystalline quartz (11.33%-23%, mean 17.83%) and minor K- feldspar, predominantly orthoclase (mean 3.03%), with generally lesser microcline (mean 1.73%). Albite/plagiocase is rare to absent, in contrast to the Lange Formation. It is possible that albite/plagioclase has been selectively leached during diagenesis; K-feldspars have also been partly leached (Figure 4.3E). Other minor framework grains include lithic grains (principally quartzo- feldspathic granitic grains, mean 3.66%) and heavy minerals (0-2.33%), which consist of garnet, rutile, tourmaline, opaques and zircon. Garnet concentrations are locally notable feature of the Garn Formation, for example at 3551.34m, Figure 4.3G. Skeletal grains may have been completely dissolved during diagenesis, as is suggested by the presence of oversized pores like those shown in Figure 4.3F. Ductile components are generally scarce (mean 1.31%) in the Garn Formation except near its base where mica and intraclasts are notable components. The ductile components include detrital mud (0- 1.33%), mica - principally muscovite and sericite - which has commonly been expanded and replaced by kaolinite and illite, as well as minor plant fragments (0-trace) and mudstone intraclasts (0-2%). Detrital clays, if present, are commonly concentrated along microstylolites and in finer laminae (Figure 4.3C) and in mottles possibly produced by bioturbation. 4.3.2 Authigenic Mineralogy Diagenetic modification of the Garn sandstones, although moderately pronounced (authigenic clays plus cements: mean 9.53%), is less marked than in the other Jurassic formations (means Not 25.81%, Ile 27.25%, Ror 53.33% and Tilje 19.04%). This, coupled with their generally cleaner (ie. poor in mica and detrital clay) and coarser grained nature, means that reservoir quality is significantly better than in the other formations. Page 30', 'Passage_id': 663}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The authigenic mineralogy of the Garn Formation is dominated by quartz overgrowth cement 0.33%- D, and G, 4.4A, B, and D). The kaolinite occurs mainly in primary intergranular pores (mean 2.93%) and also replaces grains (mean 0.63%, mainly mica, Figure 4.3B) and in secondary pores formed by the dissolution of feldspars. A notable difference between the Garn sandstones in 6507/5-4 and 6507/5-2 is the absence of feldspar overgrowths in the former well in contrast to the latter where up to 5.4% was recorded (RRI Report No. 8321/Id). This suggests slightly different pore fluid histories in the vicinities of the two wells. The overgrowths are also absent from the equivalent sandstones in 6507/5-1 (BP Amoco, 1999). Other minor authigenic minerals include:  illitic (0-2%) and indeterminate (0-0.66%) clays which locally coat and replace grains; illite has also partly replaced by authigenic kaolinite;  feldspar overgrowths (0-trace);  siderite (trace-1.99%, mean 0.7%) which mainly forms coarse crystals in intergranular pores;  ferroan dolomite (0-0.35%), which is mainly intergranular;  pyrite (0-3.66%) which is mainly intergranular. 4.3.3 Sandstone Quality and Pore System Make-up The analysed Garn sandstones are characterised by moderate porosities (15.6%-20.9%) and good to excellent permeabilities (330 mD-7470 mD). These relatively coarse grained and generally clay- and mica-poor sandstones contain clean, quartz-lined, well to very well connected, primary intergranular macropore-dominated networks, which are enhanced by subordinate grain dissolution macropores (Figures 4.3F). Significant amounts (c. 21 percentage points) of intergranular porosity and connectivity have been lost as result of compaction, despite the rarity of ductile grains. Furthermore, the general paucity of ductile components means that microporosity is generally minor (mean 5.39%) and occurs mainly in authigenic kaolinite and in partly leached feldspar grains. 4.3.4 Variation Between Reservoir Zones In view of the fact that the Garn Formation constitutes the principal reservoir interval in the 6507/5-4 well, the key differences in the textural and mineralogical make-up of the three reservoir zones is briefly summarised below:  Zone JS14 (3506.15m-3538.28m MD). Petrographic samples from these sandstones are, on average, finer grained, better sorted and poorer in kaolinite than their JS13 or JS12 counterparts (Enclosure 6). Considering the whole core analysis database, this zone has the highest average permeability (Figure 6.4, Figure 4.5) in the Garn Formation and this may be related to its relatively low authigenic clay content and relatively good sorting.  Zone JS13 (3528.28m-3554.13m MD). This zone has the lowest average helium porosity and horizontal permeability of the three zones in the Garn (Figure 6.4, Figure 4.5) and this may be related partly to its relatively poor sorting and relatively high kaolinite content relative to zone JS14. Although not seen in abundance in this section, macroscopic description of the core suggests that the patchy presence of carbonate (?ferroan dolomite and siderite) is preferentially Page 31', 'Passage_id': 664}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: developed within this zone. These cements are unlikely to have significant effect on fluid flow at the reservoir scale.  Zone JS12 (3554.13m-3564.42m MD). The petrographic samples from this zone are on average the coarsest grained, contain the most kaolinite and least quartz overgrowth cement of the three Garn zones. The relatively high abundance of kaolinite may be facies controlled since the zone has relatively high gamma ray response (Enclosure 4), suggesting that it was originally relatively rich in detrital mud and/or mica and/or mudstone intraclasts. The zone has the highest average helium porosity (Figure 6.4, Figure 4.5) and this is probably partly related to the relatively low abundance of quartz cement and the presence of microporosity in the authigenic clays. 4.4 NOT FORMATION 4.4.1 Sandstone Texture and Detrital Mineralogy The Not Formation in this well forms cleaning and coarsening upward sequence that is divided into two zones, JS11 and JS12, and the coarse Garn-like sandstones seen in 6507/5-4 are missing. The sandstone samples of the Not Formation (n=4) comprise very fine and fine grained, mainly well sorted, mainly sublithic arenites (Figures 4.19, and 4.7). At the scale of thin section, the samples are laminated (Figure 4.6B) and some show ripples or burrows. The sand grains are commonly subangular to subrounded in shape. Slightly sutured and concavo-convex grain contacts indicate that moderate amount of pressure solution has occurred. Their framework mineralogy is dominated by monocrystalline quartz (32.66%-42%, mean 38.33%), with subordinate polycrystalline quartz (8.33%-11.33%, mean 9.58%), feldspars comprising albite (mean 0.75%), orthoclase (mean 5.67%) and microcline (mean 3.08%), rock fragments (mean 2.57%, mainly granitic) and heavy minerals (0.33%-6.33%, mean 1.83%) which are locally concentrated in laminae (Figure 4.6C). Ductile components are dominated by mica (1.66%-11.33%, mean 5%, mainly muscovite, Figure 4.6B, and F, 4.7D), with lesser amounts of detrital clay (0-3%), fine plant debris (0-1%) and mudstone intraclasts (0-1.33%). 4.4.2 Authigenic Mineralogy Diagenetic modification of these sandstones is locally pronounced (mean 25.81% authigenic minerals) and is dominated by kaolinite (mean 13.41%, Figure 4.7A, and F) which mainly replaces grains, especially micas, and fills secondary and primary pores. Less abundant authigenic minerals include quartz overgrowths (1.33%-7%, mean 3.75%, Figure 4.7C), siderite (0.66%-6.33%, mean 2.91%, mainly grain replacive and displacive), ferroan dolomite (0-3.33%), anatase/leucoxene (0- 4.99%), illitic clays (1.66%-2.32%) and indeterminate clays (0-1.99%). 4.4.3 Sandstone Quality and Pore System Make-up These sandstones, because of their finer grained and more ductile-rich nature, support mixed to micropore-dominated pore networks in which primary intergranular macropores are mainly extra fine and generally poorly connected. The petrographic samples have poor to moderate porosity (10.2%- 19.7%), and poor to moderate permeabilities (0.802 mD-115 mD). The JS11 sandstones tend to have Page 32', 'Passage_id': 665}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 6.13%, Figure 4.11B) which is only common in three of the samples and which commonly replaces detrital mud. Other authigenic phases include quartz overgrowths (mean 3.23%, Figure 4.11D, 4.12A) and ferroan dolomite (mean 0.23%). Significant amounts of porosity have been destroyed during compaction. 4.7.2 Sandstone Quality and Pore System Make-up The Tilje sandstones commonly have moderate to good porosities (commonly 15%-20%) but generally only moderate to poor permeabilities (typically mD-30 mD) on account of the destruction of both pore volume and particularly connectivity principally by kaolinite and quartz cementation and compaction. The fine sandstones tend to have pore networks with roughly equal volumes of macropores and micropores which are moderately to poorly connected. Secondary pores formed by the dissolution of feldspar grains form significant proportion of the macropores in the Tilje and are locally more abundant than primary intergranular macropores. The highest permeabilities (c. 100 mD-1000 mD) occur in the relatively coarse grained sandstones of reservoir zone JS6 (Figure 4.15) where macropores and pore throats tend to be relatively large. 4.8 PARAGENESIS The paragenetic sequence for the Jurassic sandstones in the 6507/5-4 well is briefly summarised/outlined below and illustrated in Figure 4.7. This discussion also assesses the impact of mineral authigenesis on sandstone quality. The earliest paragenetic events include phosphate (Ror Formation only), siderite, and negligible to minor precipitation of pyrite, and possibly the dissolution and reprecipitation of titanium-rich heavy minerals, such as anatase. Localised chloritisation of detrital clay is also thought most likely to have occurred at this time within the Tilje (e.g. Plug 604, Figure 4.3E) and lowermost Garn Formations. It is interesting to note that the two intervals in which chloritic clays are present (Plugs 110 and 604; Figures 4.3A, 4.3B and 4.3E) are in close proximity to the intervals in which iron-enriched pore- fluids are known to have been present (i.e. immediately above the so called very high gamma unit at the top of the Not Formation, and in the Tilje Formation where siderite precipitation is most pronounced). However, it remains ambiguous as to whether the green-coloured clays are detrital sense stricto, or whether chloritisation of detrital precursor clay has occurred. Kaolinitisation of mica is also considered to be relatively early diagenetic event, as this type of kaolinite commonly shows signs of illitisation (cf. later burial-related kaolinite authigenesis, sourced through the dissolution of unstable grains), as is feldspar overgrowth development. In the case of the latter, relatively early paragenesis is evidenced by the fact that these overgrowths may be partially enveloped by quartz overgrowths. Furthermore, the dusty appearance of these overgrowths suggests that they have been incipiently altered, and in places dissolution is clearly evident. Although siderite authigenesis is for the most part considered to be early, petrographical review suggests that more than one phase of siderite precipitation may have occurred. For example, in the Tilje Formation, three different morphologies of siderite are noted:  finely crystalline to microspherulitic, grain-fringing cement that clearly pre-dates grain dissolution and kaolinite cementation;  more coarsely crystalline, blocky, secondary pore-filling cement that appears to precipitate preferentially within secondary dissolution macropores fringed by microcrystalline siderite. It would also appear from thin section that this phase of siderite cement is partially Page 35', 'Passage_id': 666}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: enveloped/overlain by secondary pore-filling quartz cements, and that these secondary pores in which the siderite occurs are free from kaolinite;  as later dogs-tooth fringe on the secondary pore-filling cements. Elsewhere, for example within the Garn Formation, there is evidence to suggest that minor, late phase of siderite cementation/replacement has occurred, because lozenges, and more rarely coarsely crystalline cements, enclose and corrode quartz overgrowths. It is suggested that even though the relative timing of siderite authigenesis is broadly synchronous throughout the Jurassic succession in the 6507/5-4 well, differences in pore water chemistry (i.e. localised diagenetic environments) may give rise to subtle variances in the overall paragenesis and number of siderite phases which have occurred. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to suggest for example that an early, minor phase of dissolution, followed by quartz and kaolinite authigenesis (?associated with meteoric flushing) may have occurred within the Tilje Formation. It is interesting to note that XRD analysis indicates that the composition of the siderite within the Tilje Formation is pure, whereas its composition in the other formations is more magnesium-rich (Table 4.1). Later diagenetic events related to burial include feldspar dissolution, and quartz and kaolinite precipitation. However in the absence of cathodoluminescence or detailed geochemical data it is difficult to determine how many phases of quartz cementation have occurred. The illitisation of kaolinitised mica, and not the other kaolinite types identified, suggests that illitisation occurred prior to the main onset of quartz and kaolinite authigenesis. In addition, authigenic fibres of illite are enclosed by quartz overgrowths, suggesting that quartz was the later phase. The coeval development of kaolinite and quartz is evidenced by their partial intergrowth. Similarly, the contamination of secondary intraparticle dissolution macropores by kaolinite, and more rarely quartz, indicates that grain dissolution and kaolinite authigenesis were partially synchronous. Indeed, petrographical review suggests that at least two phases of kaolinite authigenesis have occurred, albeit the earlier one may principally, formed as replacement of mica. late, post-quartz timing for hydrocarbon ingress into the Garn reservoir is suggested by the fact that residual hydrocarbon appears to overlie quartz overgrowths in these sandstones. Note, however, that within the upper Not Garn-like sandstones, the presence of petroleum-bearing inclusions within the quartz overgrowths suggests that ingress of hydrocarbon-bearing fluids into the Not reservoir at least, was partially co-incident with quartz authigenesis. Timing of ferroan dolomite and ferroan calcite cementation is more equivocal, but on the basis of the relationships observed primarily in the Not Sandstones, it is suggested that both are late burial cements:  Ferroan dolomite overlies and locally corrodes quartz overgrowths in which petroleum-bearing inclusions are present. Note that the timing of hydrocarbon ingress relative to ferroan dolomite cementation is more equivocal, as the recognition of inclusions in the carbonate cements has not been possible.  Ferroan dolomite replaces and partially envelopes kaolinite booklets.  Ferroan calcite cements are overlain and corroded by ferroan dolomite.  Ferroan calcite appears to overlie, and therefore post-date quartz overgrowth cements. Page 36', 'Passage_id': 667}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Other minor or trace late burial cements/replacement include pyrite, barite and possibly siderite, however, the paucity of these minerals means that their degradation of the pore network and hence sandstone quality is negligible. Of these later burial cements, quartz, kaolinite and to lesser degree illite, are important degraders of quality, whilst grain dissolution has locally supplemented, and in the case of the Tilje sandstones, has significantly bolstered porosity. 4.9 SUMMARY The petrographic samples from the Lange Formation are mainly poorly to well sorted, fine to medium grained, lithic, sublithic and subarkosic arenites. Their framework mineralogy is dominated by quartz and feldspars, lithic grains and bioclasts are also present. Ductile components such as detrital mud, mica, mudstone clasts, plant debris and glauconite are common in many of the samples. The main authigenic minerals are ferroan calcite, kaolinite and siderite and the sandstones have been moderately compacted. The better quality reservoir sandstones tend to be clean, medium grained and contain only minor cement and have pore networks dominated by primary, intergranular macropores. However, many of the Lange sandstones have poor reservoir properties because of their very fine grain size, high content of ductile components and locally abundant ferroan calcite cement. The petrographic samples from the Garn, Not, Ile, Ror and Tilje Formations in the 6507/5-4 well comprise very fine (lower) to very coarse (lower)-grained, well to poorly sorted, sublithic to lithic sandstones, in which ductile abundances (trace-15.32%), in particular detrital clay and mica content, are highly variable. Their framework mineralogy is dominated by monocrystalline quartz, with subordinate to minor polycrystalline quartz, feldspar (principally K-feldspar) and lithic grains of igneous/metamorphic derivation. Heavy minerals are ubiquitous; it may be significant that garnet was only recorded in the Garn and Not Formations and that zircon predominates in the Tilje. Ductile components are dominated by mica and locally detrital mud, with generally minor fine plant debris, intraclasts, peloids, ooids and ductile rock fragments. Mica is particularly abundant in some of the samples from the Not Formation. Diagenetic modification (total authigenic minerals: 2.69%-44.29%) is pronounced overall, though the Garn Formation is clearly the least cemented formation (total authigenic minerals: 2.69%-19.66% mean 9.54%). The main authigenic minerals are quartz (0-12.33%, mean 3.79%), kaolinite (0- 17.32%, mean 6.17%), siderite (0-50.66%, mean 5.25%), and more locally optically indeterminate clays (0-13.67%, mean 1.08%), illitic clays (0-9.99%, mean 1.05%) and ferroan dolomite (0-11.33%, mean 1.1%). Other minor cementing/replacive phases include pyrite, anatase and apatite. These sandstones have lost significant amount of their original intergranular porosity as result of compaction and this effect was probably most severe in micaceous and argillaceous facies. Grain dissolution, although evident throughout the succession, is most pronounced in the Tilje sandstones (mean secondary macropores: 4.5%). Pore systems within these sandstones are strongly conditioned by the extent to which they have been diagenetically modified, such that micropore-dominated networks occur where kaolinitisation is pronounced, even within the coarser grained sandstone facies. Macropore-dominated pore systems are dominant where diagenetic modification is largely limited to minor quartz cementation and compaction. Page 37', 'Passage_id': 668}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In summary, by formation:  The Garn Formation is characterised by very clean, clay-poor (average detrital mud 0.37%), mainly medium grained, moderately to poorly sorted sandstones in which diagenetic modification (mean authigenic minerals 9.54%) is dominated by kaolinite authigenesis (mean 5.1%) and quartz cementation (mean 2.66%). These sandstones support clean, well connected, primary intergranular macropore dominated pore systems.  The Not sandstones (JS10) are very fine to fine grained, mainly well sorted, and rich in ductile components such as mica (mean 5%). Diagenetic modification of these sandstones is pronounced (mean authigenic minerals 25.81%). The authigenic assemblage notably includes kaolinite (mean 13.41%), quartz (mean 3.75%), siderite (mean 2.91%) and ferroan dolomite (mean 1.67%). Consequently, these sandstones generally contain micropore dominated pore networks.  The Ile Formation samples are mainly very fine and well sorted, though coarser, less well sorted facies are also represented. Ductile components, mainly peloids and mud, are not in general abundant (mean 5.13%). Diagenetic overprinting (mean authigenic minerals 27.24%) is pronounced, the main components being quartz (mean 7.93%), siderite (mean 5.4%) and ferroan dolomite (mean 4.4%). These sandstones support mixed to micropore dominated pore networks.  The Ror Formation; single sample of argillaceous, very fine grained sandstone has been heavily cemented by siderite.  The Tilje Formation is characterised by fine to locally coarse grained, poorly to well sorted, ductile poor (mean 1.36%) sandstones, in which diagenetic modification by quartz (mean 3.23%) and kaolinite (mean 6.35%) is moderate. Siderite (max. 27.99%) precipitation is also locally pronounced in this succession, with grain dissolution also locally prominent. These sandstones generally support dissolution modified, mixed to locally macropore dominated pore networks, in which pore connectivity has been impaired by quartz and kaolinite cementation.

As result of regional work in the Mid Norway area, Robertson have erected broadly chronostratigraphic zonation scheme for the entire Lower to Middle Jurassic which was defined in the Lower to Middle Jurassic reservoir study (RRI, Report No. EM079) and refined slightly in recent update to that study (RRI, Report No. EM129). more detailed scheme erected specifically for the Skarv area is also discussed and brief outline of the potential sequence stratigraphic framework of the study interval is also included. 5.2 ZONATION SCHEMES Two zonation schemes have been applied to the Jurassic interval in the study well. The first is based on that erected during regional study of the Lower to Middle Jurassic of Mid Norway and is defined in Chapter of that report (RRI Report No. EM079, 1997). The lithostratigraphic scheme proposed by Dalland et al. (1988) for the Mid Norway area is largely retained, although there are some important observations that impact on the precise definition and picking of formation tops and bases. This zonation scheme was based on study of all released wells in the Mid Norway area and is constrained by detailed palynostratigraphy. The individual zones are correlative packages defined by variety of surfaces (forced progradational bases, flooding surfaces etc.) and form the basis for the definition and understanding of the sequence architecture of the study interval. The constituent zones have been identified in the 6507/5-4 well and are included on the 1:200 scale data summary chart (Enclosure 4) and in the study database on the accompanying CD ROM. Picking of the zones in the 6507/5-4 well relies on combination of detailed observations from the core, the breakdown applied to the nearby 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, regional understanding of facies distributions and integration with the available biostratigraphic data. A second, more detailed reservoir zonation scheme has been erected for the main part of the Lower to Middle Jurassic interval in well 6507/5-4, based on an identification of correlative surfaces between the 6507/5-2, 6507/5-1 and 6507/6-2 wells. The scheme was erected by BP Amoco in consultation with RRI and is based on recognisable log signatures constrained by the core studies. This scheme is specific to the Skarv area and may have direct relevance to production concerns and the recognition of flow units.

The top of the Melke Formation occurs at and regionally coincides with an abrupt reduction in gamma values from the overlying Spekk Formation. The sediments of the Melke Formation are not assigned facies codes, as no core was taken, but regionally they are assigned to Facies EA5 (bioturbated shelfal sediments), with abundant mud-dominated bioturbated shelfal sediments (Facies EA5b) interbedded with lesser, sand- dominated bioturbated shelfal sediments (Facies EA5a). The bioturbated nature of these mudstones cannot be ascertained with confidence from the log suites, but is based on comparison with cored intervals of the Melke Formation in other released wells in the Mid Norway area. The base of the Melke Formation is placed at 3495.15m dd, where it is expected to be in unconformable contact with an Aalenian mudstone assigned to the Not Formation. The probable Aalenian age of this mudstone is constrained by the available biostratigraphic data, which in the 6507/5-4 well includes tentative micropalaentological support (see RRI Report No. 6072/Ia). The presence of this mudstone is further supported by regional evidence and the slightly anomalous log profiles relative to the overlying Melke Formation. The Garn Formation in well 6507/5-4 consists of Zones G1 and ?G2, and is believed to be entirely Aalenian in age. There is no evidence for the presence of the Bajocian to Bathonian Garn recognised in areas to the south of Smrbukk, and the Aalenian age is constrained by the recognition of an Aalenian mudstone ascribed to Zone Not immediately above the Garn Formation. The Garn Formation in 6507/5-4 is tentatively divided into an upper interval ascribed to Zone G2 and a lower interval of Zone G1. The contact between Zone G1 and G2 is picked on the base of minor intra-sandwave channel at level with notable amount of carbonaceous fragments, which is thought to correlate with the coal in well 6507/5-2. The Garn sandstones above this surface have characteristic facies signature which is distinct from the underlying parts of the Garn and is similar to the upper parts of the Garn recognised in the 6507/5-1, 6507/5-2 and 6507/6-2 wells. Zone Garn is equivalent to Reservoir Zone JS12 and JS13, and Zone Garn to Reservoir Zone JS14. Zone G2 consists of slightly lower energy, finer grained and more thinly bedded minor sandwave and sandwave flank sediments relative to Zone G1, with lighter colour and apparent visual difference in cementation. It is thought likely that this upper part of the Garn Formation represents an entirely separate sandbody to that below. The petrographic data further support this supposition in well 6507/5-2, with the sandstones of Zone G2 containing slightly different mineralogy and, in particular, well developed feldspar overgrowth cements are absent from the sandstones of Zone G2 within the study well. It is thought that the sandbody represented by Zone G2 in the 6507/5-4 well is directly correlative to that in wells 6507/5-1, 6507/5-2 and 6507/6-2, but represents separate unit to the Garn sands recognised in Smrbukk and other areas further to the south. Cross bedding surfaces in Zone G2 were clearly recognised from the core goniometry. The relative abundance of these surfaces in comparison to the underlying sands further support the zonation and suggest complex variety of palaeocurrent directions. Core goniometry results suggest an azimuth towards the NW or west, although significant subset of the dip data indicates subsidiary current towards the NE. Page 40', 'Passage_id': 681}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The lower and middle parts of the Garn Formation (Zone G1) are dominated by relatively clean, medium to locally coarse-grained sandstones. The lowermost interval has broadly coarsening upwards character that is capped by coarser grained, granule-rich unit. This interval represents the establishment and growth of major tidal sandwave system and the coarsening upwards represents natural continuation of the facies succession seen in the underlying Not Formation. Above the coarse grained unit the Garn Formation has poorly structured fabric, consisting of variably bioturbated sandwave crest and sandwave flank sediments. similar poorly structured unit was recognised in the other Skarv wells, but in 6507/5-4 is capped by thin, non-marine mudstone overlain by tidal, sandwave unit with remarkably consistent foreset dip and high dip angle. Core goniometry data suggest that this unit prograded in westerly direction. The Not Formation is well developed in 6507/5-4 and represents prograding shelfal to shoreface system. The lower and middle parts of the Not Formation are ascribed to Zone Not and the upper parts to Zone Not 2. The contact between Zones N1 and N2 is based on log pick at the base of high gamma unit although, as in wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2, this does not correspond to well defined facies break. This high gamma unit is associated with high heavy mineral concentrations of an extra-basinal origin. Zone Not is equivalent to Reservoir Zone JS11 and Not represents Reservoir Zone JS10. In the 6507/5-4 well, Zone Not is dominated by bioturbated shelfal to shoreface sediments, and the overlying sediments of Zone Not by finely laminated lower to middle shoreface sandstones in lower parts, overlain by medium-grained interval of upper shoreface sandstones. The coarse- grained sandstone unit seen in 6507/5-2 is not seen in this study. However, the general pattern of extremely laterally continuous rock units in the Not Formation is still supported. The very high gamma values in uppermost parts of the Not Formation are not due to the presence of micaceous laminae but, as demonstrated elsewhere in this report, represent anomalous concentrations of heavy minerals including abundant zircon and monazite. This high gamma interval can be recognised in most parts of the Mid Norway region and may be of use as chronostratigraphic marker horizon. The Ile Formation in well 6507/5-4 is dramatically thinned relative to that encountered in the 6507/5-1 well but similar to that in 6507/5-2. The formation has broadly similar facies character dominated by bioturbated shelfal sediments with generally poor reservoir quality. There is no evidence for any shoreface attached sediments in the cored interval. As with the other Skarv wells, application of the RRI regional zonation to the Ile Formation in well 6507/5-4 is particularly problematic and, although the regional zones (I1 to I4) can be recognised in the study well, the alternative reservoir zonation erected by BP Amoco in consultation with RRI may be more appropriate for local facies and reservoir modelling. Use of the regional scheme does, however, allow for wider scale correlation of this part of the succession and the zones are briefly defined below: Zone I1: This represents the lower part of the Ile Formation with base picked at 3617.78m dd marking the base of the Ile Formation. Zone I1 has coarsening and cleaning upwards profile. The top of the zone is very poorly defined in the study well but is tentatively picked towards the top of the coarsening upwards sequence with change to slightly more blocky grain size profile. Page 41', 'Passage_id': 682}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Zone I2: This is particularly thin zone and is picked as slightly more-blocky unit towards the top of the basal sandbody of the Ile Formation and has base at 3617.78m dd. The top of the zone is picked at very slight grain size change corresponding to measured depth of 3616.63m. Notably within this zone there is very distinctive sandstone intra-clast lag at 3616.63m dd. Zone I3: Zone I3 represents the bulk of the middle and upper parts of the Ile Formation in this study well and wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2. The interval as whole has heterogeneous character consisting of interbedded bioturbated sandstones, thin storm dominated shelfal deposits and coarse- grained marine erosional lag and sub-tidal channel deposits. As with other intervals of the Ile Formation, Zone I3 is significantly thinner in 6507/5-4 than in the nearby 6507/5-1 well but is subsequently similar to that in 6507/5-2. Zone I4: Zone I4 is the one regional unit of the Ile Formation that is well defined in the Skarv area, and corresponds to Reservoir Subzone JS9.8 at the very top of the Ile Formation. This zone consists of relatively thin unit of intensely bioturbated shelfal sediments of Facies EA5 containing thin mudstone unit at the base, with base at depth of 3601.9m dd. The top of the unit is defined on both the gamma and density-neutron logs at depth of 3598.95m dd and represents the top of the Ile Formation. In common with the other Skarv wells, the Ile Formation in well 6507/5-4 represents distal development of this interval compared to areas further to the south and southwest. Detailed facies analysis (Chapter 3) demonstrates that the Ile Formation in the Skarv area was deposited in an open marine, shelfal environment subject to episodic storm events, but with little evidence for nearshore or marginal marine setting. Regional mapping of Ile facies suggests shoreline and source region to the west of Mid Norway and, in contrast to the Not-Garn and Tilje sequences, relatively restricted point source (RRI, 1997; 1999). The Ile Formation in the Skarv area represents an intermediate facies between the proximal Ile Formation of the Smrbukk area and the very distal and condensed Ile Formation of Norne. Despite the highly condensed nature of the Ile succession preserved in the 6507/5-4 well, the facies are very similar to those recognised in the other Skarv wells and are not as distal as those in the Norne area. The condensed nature of the succession is consequently interpreted to represent localised depositional thinning, probably associated with lower subsidence rate, rather than deposition in more distal location. As noted in the 6507/5-1 core study: Evidence from the Norne area suggests that syn-depositional variations in rates of subsidence may allow for local condensing of the Ile Formation over specific structures It appears that the thin Ile section in 6507/5-4 results from such process, but that this has not resulted in improved reservoir quality. The recognition of consistent facies trend from Smrbukk, through the Skarv structure and further north to Norne gives an impression of the likely scale of lateral facies changes within the Ile Formation and it is thought unlikely that clean shoreface or marginal marine sandstones will occur within the Ile Formation in any part of the Skarv structure. The Ror Formation in well 6507/5-4 is very similar to that encountered in 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2, and consists of relatively thick sequence of intensely bioturbated shelfal sediments which have been subdivided into six packages, Ror (R1) at the base, to Ror (R6) at the top. However, due to the lack of distinct facies changes in the cored interval, these packages are not always well defined. These are briefly described below: Page 42', 'Passage_id': 683}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id Zone R1: In core, this zone is dominated by very argillaceous, fine upper to medium grained, bioturbated sandstones that are notably coarser than the overlying parts of the Ror Formation. Zone R1 has subtle fining upwards profile reflected on both the gamma and neutron-density logs. The top of R1 is picked at depth of 3672.39m dd and is characterised by relatively abrupt decrease in the modal grain size interpreted to represent relative deepening event. On the logs this surface is marked by an increase in the magnitude of the negative crossover between the density and neutron traces and an increase in gamma API values. Zone R2: This zone is dominated by silty and sandy mudstones of Facies EA5a. This zone was uncored in the 6507/5-1 well, but the log signatures of this interval are similar in both wells, with characteristic high gamma ray response and strongly negative neutron-density cross-over. In the study well, this zone contrasts with that seen in other Skarv wells as it is not as argillaceous and does not include the maximum flooding surface described in well 6507/5-2. Zone R3: This zone is broadly similar to Zone R2 and is again dominated by bioturbated silty and sandy mudstones with similar log response. In core, however, this zone is very slightly coarser grained than Zone R2, contains greater proportion of sand and has slightly different and more diverse association of trace fossils. The overall progradational profile that commonly characterises Zone R3 is weakly developed in the study well but is tentatively recognised in core. Elsewhere in Mid Norway the base of this zone is interpreted as sequence boundary, although the apparently subdued response in the study well may result from its distal location. Zone R3 comprises the main part of the Tofte Formation where it occurs in areas to the south and west of the study area. Such sands appear to be entirely absent in the Skarv area. Zone R4: The base of Zone R4 is picked at depth of 3657.25m dd, marking the termination of the upwards decreasing gamma profile of Zone R3 and is tentatively interpreted as flooding surface. The zone is dominated by intensely bioturbated, highly argillaceous sandstones and has characteristic progradational log profile that is typical of this zone in much of the Mid Norway area. The top is picked at the next candidate flooding surface at depth of 3637.1m dd. Variations in ichnofabrics suggest reduction in sedimentation rate in upper parts of this zone, immediately prior to the relative flooding event. Zone R5: This zone is relatively thin in the 6507/5-4 well and corresponds to Reservoir Subzone JS7.8. The base occurs at depth of 3637.1m dd, marking minor relative flooding event which is reflected on the logs by an abrupt increase in the gamma response and slightly more negative neutron-density crossover. An overall increase in the abundance of Teichichnus traces relative to other trace fossils is characteristic of this zone and was also recognised in the 6507/5-2 well. These features may suggest decreased aggradation rate and decrease in overall sedimentation rates in lower energy depositional environment. The base of Zone R5 is consequently interpreted as flooding and basin deepening event which is characteristic of this interval throughout the Mid Norway area. Zone R5 is more heterogeneous than lower parts of the Ror Formation and has progradational profile that is well displayed on logs in the 6507/5-4 well but is only poorly defined in core. Zone R6: This is the uppermost interval of the Ror Formation with base picked at depth of 3630.08m dd and corresponds to Reservoir Subzone JS7.9. This unit is very distinctive in core and contains sequence of sediments showing abundant evidence of significant erosion and depositional condensing. The interval contains locally very abundant glauconite/chamosite, including common chamositic ooliths, bioclastic debris and distinctive suite of ?early diagenetic cements including pyrite and very abundant siderite. The pyrite and siderite, in particular, result in high density and the log suite through this interval has characteristic profile that is matched in the 6507/5-2 well Page 43', 'Passage_id': 684}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: where the zone was also cored and contained similar sediments. This interval is likely to mark significant hiatal surface that may be regional in extent. The Tilje Formation encountered in well 6507/5-4 represents well-developed interval that has the characteristic heterolithic to super-heterolithic bedding typical of the Tilje Formation over most of Mid Norway. In contrast to most parts of the Halten Terrace, the Tilje in the study well displays better developed and unequivocal marine influence that includes well developed sequence of stacked sandstones with fully marine trace fossil assemblage similar to that recognised in well 6507/5-1. This sandbody is interpreted to represent marginal marine (possibly slightly restricted) shoreface environment. The base of the formation is uncored in 6507/5-4 but is marked by the base of prominent sandstone above the muddy re Shale. The top is generally defined by the base of the dark grey, Toarcian aged mudstones of the Ror Formation. The Tilje Formation is entirely Pliensbachian in age and six zones are informally recognised, all of which are recognised within the study well; consisting of Tilje (T1) at the base to Tilje (T6) at the top. The zones are briefly described below: Zone Tilje 1: This is the lowermost zone of the Tilje Formation and the base corresponds to the base of the Tilje Formation at depth of 3765.5m dd in well 6507/5-4 and the zone is uncored. The zone is probably heterolithic with crude, broadly progradational signature that is typical of this zone over much of the Mid Norway area. blocky sandstone is present at the base of the zone and appears to replace the heterolithic tidal sediments recognised at the same level in 6507/5-1. Zone Tilje 2: This zone is uncored in the study well but log signatures suggest that it is characterised by the presence of well-developed mudstones interbedded with variety of sand-rich non-marine to marine sediments. The base of the zone is picked at 3750.77m, immediately above possible transgressive unit. The top of the zone coincides with the base of the stacked sandstones that dominate Zone Tilje and is likely to be slightly erosional in character. There is thought to be some potential for erosional truncation of the uppermost parts of Zone Tilje at the base Tilje surface. Zone Tilje 3: This zone consists of stacked, marine to marginal marine, shoreface sandstones and is cored only in the uppermost parts, similar to that in well 6507/5-2. This interval forms distinctive, high net to gross unit and is recognised over much of Mid Norway, having blocky log profile. The base is picked at depth of 3736.39m dd and the top at 3718.07m dd, where it is overlain by well- developed, regionally extensive mudstone at the base of Tilje 4. The zone contains single well- developed mudstone in middle parts which can be correlated to the 6507/5-1 and 6507/6-2 wells. strong marine influence characterises this zone, which represents mixture of shallow to marginal marine shoreface sandstones in lower parts and marine shelf sediments in upper parts. The marine influence contrasts with the probable non-marine to restricted marine nature of the upper part of Zone Tilje 2, although lack of core in the study well limits the confidence of this interpretation. Similar bioturbated sandstones are recognised at this level in the Heidrun area and in the 6507/5-1 well, but in southern parts of the Halten Terrace Tilje is typically non-marine in character. Regional evidence strongly suggests that the base of Zone Tilje is associated with an abrupt increase in net to gross and dislocation of facies with slight to locally significant erosion of the upper parts of Tilje 2. The base Tilje surface is consequently interpreted as sequence boundary and may be more significant stratigraphic surface than the base of the Tilje Formation. Zone Tilje 4: This zone is entirely cored within the study well with base marked by regionally extensive lagoon bay mudstone that is correlated with confidence to the other Skarv wells and both to Page 44', 'Passage_id': 685}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: the north of the study well (6507/3-1 and Norne) and to the south into the Heidrun area. The top of the zone is picked on thin, intensely bioturbated abandonment unit initially seen in well 6507/5-1 and is overlain by mudstone. The mudstones at the base of the zone include highly restricted lagoon/bay sediments, and also have marine influenced units, with interbedded sandstones containing an unequivocal marine ichnofauna. Middle and upper parts of T4 are dominated by stacked, restricted shoreface and shallow shelfal sandstones with consistent fine uppermost grain size. The high net to gross of this interval as whole and the evident marine influence contrasts with the same stratigraphic unit in the Heidrun area but is very similar to that encountered in well 6507/5-1. Further south (e.g. Heidrun Field) this zone is typically super heterolithic and consists of interbedded tidal channel sands, minor mouthbars and lagoon/bay mudstones. Zone Tilje 5: Tilje is well developed and entirely cored in 6507/5-4 consisting of heterolithic, thinly interbedded sandstones and mudstones which dominate the upper part of the Tilje Formation. The base is picked at 3702.68m dd and the top at 3684.13m dd. Most of Tilje represents highly restricted marginal marine sediments dominated by mouthbars and restricted marine lagoon/bay sands with minor small tidal channel sandstones. tidal signature is common and the trace fossil assemblage consists of very low diversity suite with dominance of large Diplocraterion traces. In comparison to the underlying sandstones of Tilje 4, this zone represents significantly more proximal and restricted depositional setting, similar to that encountered in well in both 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2. Zone Tilje 6: In contrast to the 6507/5-2 well this zone is present in the study well and the mudstones and argillaceous sandstones of the Ror Formation rest upon it. The transgressive sandstone unit of Zone T6 is also recognised in the 6507/5-1 well and this is interesting as the study well is closer to well 6507/5-2 than well 6507/5-1. Zone T6 has been interpreted as genetically separate unit from underlying parts of the Tilje Formation, with locally significant erosion at the base forming transgressive remnant which marks the transition from the marginal marine Tilje Formation into the open marine Ror Formation above. 5.3.7 re Formation (3773.5m-TD) The re Formation is uncored in the 6507/5-4 well but the top is picked at depth of 3765.50m dd by correlation with the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells. On regional scale, the re Formation can be subdivided into three zones, re at the base to re at the top. The 6507/5-4 well is believed to reach TD within Zone re 3, which is the uppermost interval of the re Formation and contains broadly similar suite of facies to those in lower parts of the Tilje Formation. The re interval represents more marine influenced depositional setting than lower parts of the re Formation, with the base of the zone probably representing the first significant marine influence in the Jurassic of the Mid Norway area. As point of interest, the reservoir qualities of each zone are presented in Table 5.1. 5.4 RESERVOIR ZONES AND SUBZONES A detailed reservoir zonation scheme based exclusively on the Skarv area was erected by BP Amoco in consultation with RRI. This scheme was initially established for the 6507/5-1 well by picking series of correlative surfaces that could be located with confidence in both the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells. These surfaces formed the framework for detailed reservoir zonation and this zonation scheme has been slightly amended and applied to the 6507/5-4 well. Picking of the surfaces in the new well was based on log picks which were tied to the core descriptions and subsequently compared between the extensively cored intervals in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells. The well-cored nature of Page 45', 'Passage_id': 686}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: these intervals has been fundamental in allowing detailed picking of zone and subzone contacts and for constraining the log based correlations. Without core, the scheme would be less well constrained and confidence in the correlations would be significantly lower. In most cases, zone and subzone boundaries agree with those used for the RRI scheme described above. The regional nature of the RRI scheme does, however, mean that they are not optimised for the Skarv area and in some cases significant improvement in resolution is possible for the area under consideration. The adopted scheme is presented on the 1:200 data summary chart (Enclosure 4) and is included in the study database on the enclosed CD ROM. The zones are listed in Chapter of this report where brief summary of both the sedimentological and reservoir geological character of each unit is presented. 5.5 SEQUENCES The Lower to Middle Jurassic interval in the Mid Norway area has been informally divided into number of depositional sequences (Megasequences) defined by major unconformities and subdivided into constituent sequences by smaller scale unconformities and disconformities (RRI, 1997). All of these megasequences and sequences can be recognised in the 6507/5-4 well and are displayed on the 1:500 scale data summary chart presented as Enclosure 5. The sequences were discussed in some detail in the 6507/5-1 report (RRI Report No. 8150/Id) and are only briefly described below. MEGASEQUENCE This represents the lowest parts of the Jurassic with base within the Triassic and top corresponding to the top of Zone re 1. The megasequence records the change from active rifting to more passive regional subsidence but is not encountered in the 6507/5-4 well. This megasequence is bounded at its base by the basinwide ?early Sinemurian unconformity between Zones re and re and at its top by the regional unconformity/hiatal surface between the Tilje and Ror Formations. The base is not recognised in the 6507/5-4 well but the top coincides with the top of the Tilje Formation at depth of 3686.45m MD. This megasequence is subdivided into three sequences: Sequence 2a Comprising Zones re 2, re 3, Tilje and Tilje 2, with the base equivalent to the base of the megasequence and the top defined by variably developed but regionally recognised erosional surface locally associated with degree of unconformity. This sequence records progressive increase in marine influence punctuated by discrete flooding surfaces with overlying progradational packages. Significantly, this interpretation suggests that the base of the Tilje Formation is conformable to only slightly discordant and no significant change in depositional setting occurs between the top of the re Formation into the overlying Tilje Formation. This interval is, however, uncored in the 6507/5-4 well. Sequence 2b Corresponding to Zones Tilje to Tilje inclusively, with base at 3744.39m MD and top at 3692.13m MD. Regionally, the base of this sequence represents regional erosion/unconformity surface marking an abrupt shift in facies and the onset of more sand-rich depositional system. In the 6507/5-4 well there is no evidence of significant erosion, although relatively abrupt facies transition and increase in net to gross is evident from the logs. The basal surface of Sequence 2b can Page 46', 'Passage_id': 687}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: be tentatively correlated with sequence boundary within the Gule Horn Member of the Neill Klinter Formation in East Greenland (Dam and Surlyk, 1995), and the base of the Cook Formation in the North Viking Graben. The base of Sequence 2b is interpreted as sequence boundary, with lower parts of the interval probably best viewed as transgressive systems tract with only thin to absent lowstand unit. Middle and upper parts of the sequence are best considered as relative highstand deposit. Sequence 2c This sequence comprises exclusively Zone Tilje in the Mid Norway area and is notable that it is present in well 6507/5-4, in contrast to 6507/5-2. The sequence is topped and based by sequence boundaries in the Mid-Norway area, while its representation as Tilje in well 6507/5-4 has its base marked by flooding surface. The top of Sequence 2c in well 6507/5-4 corresponds with the boundary between Megasequences and 3. This surface indicates early-mid Toarcian drowning due to the combined effects of the J16b and J18 flooding surfaces. Megasequence consists of the entirety of the Ror, Ile, Not and Garn Formations in this well, with top at the base of the Melke Formation, which is not seen in the study well. The basal surface occurs at the base of the Ror Formation, is regional in extent and is associated with non-deposition and local erosion across which major basin deepening event occurred, probably associated with significant restructuration of the basin. The top of this megasequence is defined by regional hiatus or unconformity surface that separates the probable Aalenian Not Zone from the Bajocian/Bathonian lower parts of the Melke Formation. Megasequence is divided into four constituent sequences: Sequence 3a Comprising shelfal sediments of Zones Ror and Ror deposited during period of relative sea level rise. The retrograde character of Zone Ror in the study well is similar to that recognised in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, but is atypical of this zone on regional scale. None of the highstand wedges recognised in western extremes of the Halten Terrace (the Tofte Formation) is present in the study well. Sequence 3b This interval consists of middle and upper parts of the Ror Formation (Zones Ror to Ror 6), with base at 3677.13m MD and top at 3632.70m MD. The base is poorly defined in the 6507/5-4 well. Zones Ror and Ror have the typical progradational characters of these units and are well defined in the study well. The uppermost part of this sequence comprises the fine grained sediments of Zone Ror which have condensed character. Sequence 3c Sequence 3c comprises the entirety of the Ile Formation with base at 3632.7m MD and top at 3608.7m MD. The base of the sequence is interpreted as forced regressive surface associated with a basinwards shift in facies. Elsewhere in Mid Norway, proposed phase of structural rejuvenation occurred in the late Toarcian/early Aalenian and is associated with erosion and condensing in lowermost parts of the Ile Formation. It is consequently possible that the condensed unit of Zone Ror 6 represents the base of Sequence 3c, placing the study well in particularly distal location. It is, however, common to find several condensed intervals in upper parts of the Ror Formation, the uppermost of which may or may not mark the base of Sequence 3c (base Ile). At regional scale Sequence 3c shows abrupt thickness variations associated with individual structures believed to have been active during deposition of the Ile Formation. Page 47', 'Passage_id': 688}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id Sequence 3d Comprising the Not and Garn Formations, with base at 3608.7m MD and top at 3502m MD. The base of the sequence is picked on flooding surface at the base of the Not Formation, which correlates with similar event at the base of the Rannoch Shale in the North Viking Graben and the base of the Sortehat Formation in East Greenland. The top of the sequence is placed at the base of the Melke Formation, in the study well. It is interesting to note the gradational passage from the Ile into the Not Formations in the 6507/5-4 well (a similar pattern was recognised in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells), which contrasts with the more abrupt flooding seen in more proximal areas to the south and west. Lower parts of the sequence have well developed shallowing upwards character, culminating with deposition of the high energy, shallow marine tidal sediments of the Garn Formation. The base Garn surface is not believed to represent sequence boundary, but is better viewed as forced regressive surface. Variations in sediment supply rate and the morphology of the Middle Jurassic seaway are thought most likely to control this pattern, possibly associated to tectonic rejuvenation of the hinterland. The top of this megasequence has not been adequately defined, but is likely to occur in the post Jurassic sediments not considered in this study. The base of the megasequence corresponds to an intra-Bajocian hiatal surface/unconformity that occurs at the base of the Melke Formation in well 6507/5-2 (3502m MD), but elsewhere in Mid Norway may occur within the lithostratigraphically defined Garn Formation (RRI, 1997). This unconformity can be recognised in most areas to the south of Mid Norway and equates to similar but larger hiatus in the North and South Viking Grabens, where it separates the Ness Formation from the Tarbert Formation. Sequence 4a Consisting of Zones Melke - Melke 4, the lower of which may have weakly developed progradational profiles and are separated by minor flooding events, believed to be distal correlatives of the Upper Garn Formation sand wedges recognised in more marginal areas of the basin. These units are poorly developed in the 6507/5-4 well. 5.6 CONCLUSIONS Well 6507/5-4 contains well developed Lower to Middle Jurassic interval and the good core coverage in addition to the other Skarv wells has allowed the zonation and correlation exercises described above to be undertaken with high degree of confidence. The stratigraphic zones and genetic sequences erected during previous studies are clearly recognised in the 6507/5-4 well and their depositional character is well constrained. Important conclusions include the following:  The Garn Formation is well developed and of broadly similar facies to that in other Skarv wells. The thickness relative to the 6507/5-1 well is, however, significantly reduced in response to depositional thinning resulting from lower rate of ?tectonically driven subsidence. The thinning is most pronounced in middle parts of the Garn. Despite the dramatic thinning, internal heterogeneities can be matched with the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and are consequently expected to be laterally extensive.  The base Garn surface is interpreted as forced regressive surface rather than sequence boundary, although an alternative and possible interpretation is that the surface represents initial transgression. In either case, the interpretations reduce the risk of significant truncation of the upper parts of the Not Formation by the base Garn in the Skarv area. Page 48', 'Passage_id': 689}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH:  The Ile Formation is distal in character and there is little potential for dramatic improvement in reservoir character over distances of few kilometres. In the 6507/5-4 well, the Ile is very thin and highly condensed as direct result of depositional thinning associated to reduced subsidence. This may be tectonically controlled. In the absence of strong tectonic control, the Ile Formation is expected to thin to the north and become progressively cleaner and less bioturbated to the extreme southwest. The dramatic influence of reduced subsidence at the 6507/5-4 well location does, however, document the fact that the Early and Middle Jurassic was not period of tectonic quiescence in the Mid Norway area and that syn-depositional structuration can dramatically influence reservoir properties.  The Tilje Formation can be subdivided into series of zones and is the most heterolithic and complex of the potential reservoir intervals. greater marine influence is present in middle parts of the Tilje Formation than the age equivalent intervals to the south and southwest suggesting deposition in relatively distal location. number of extremely laterally continuous mudstone intervals occur within the Tilje Formation and are expected to be continuous over the entire Skarv area.  Lower parts of the Tilje Formation are relatively mud prone and have only limited reservoir potential, although the base of the Tilje Formation can be picked with some confidence.  Correlation of well 6507/5-4 with wells from the Greater Skarv area illustrates the remarkable continuity of depositional facies across the Skarv region. The same features are observed in well 6507/5-2 and, to lesser extent, in well 6507/5-1. The same contrasts are also observed with the Heidrun and Smrbukk areas.

The data used to evaluate reservoir geology and reservoir quality is presented as series of core analysis data cross plots. These comprise Figures to and follow similar formats to those produced for the 6507/5-1 (RRI Report No. 8150/Id) and 6507/5-2 (RRI Report No. 8321/Id) studies. The complete consideration of reservoir quality controls requires an integrated approach where both primary (or depositional) controls on reservoir quality and secondary or diagenetic controls are analysed. Previous studies have demonstrated the fundamental control extended by depositional facies and have shown that primary facies can have direct control on subsequent diagenesis. Petrographic and diagenetic analysis of the 6507/5-4 section has been undertaken and is fully discussed in Chapter 4, but is used to complement discussion regarding secondary controls on reservoir geology and reservoir quality. 6.2 RESERVOIR QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS The core analysis dataset for well 6507/5- only shows moderate correlation between porosity and permeability, with correlation coefficient (R2) of (Figure 6.1). This average trend is, however, affected by the presence of clearly visible sub-trends, linked primarily to formation and the corresponding differences in lithology. The formational control on reservoir quality is well illustrated in Figures and 6.3. The formation boundaries correspond well with marked changes in reservoir quality, however, it is important to note several more specific points. The good porosities associated with the Garn Formation also continue into the upper part of the Not Formation, which consequently forms an effective reservoir (Figure 6.2). In common with wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2, the Garn Formation plots on markedly different trend than the rest of the data set (Figure 6.4). As highlighted above, some of the samples from the Not Formation have broadly similar porosity/permeability values to the poorer parts of the Garn Formation, emphasising that the base of effective reservoir is not the base of the Garn Formation. On the whole, the Not, Ile and Tilje Formations all plot on similar trend, with moderately good relationship between porosity and permeability. The Ror Formation is characterised by very poor to moderate reservoir quality and exhibits little correlation between porosity and permeability. Page 50', 'Passage_id': 691}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Samples from the Garn Formation have grossly similar porosities to the better samples in the Not, Ile and Tilje but with much better permeabilities (Table 6.1, Figure 6.4). When considered in isolation, the Garn Formation exhibits poor correlation between porosity and permeability, with R2=0.18. This is largely function of lack of poor reservoir quality samples with essentially all samples having permeabilities >100mD. In comparison with other Skarv wells, the Garn Formation has slightly lower porosities with mean of 17.89%, compared with 19.0% in well 6507/5-2, but slightly more favourable permeabilities with geomean of 979.7mD, compared with 944.3mD in well 6507/5-2. The Not Formation is characterised by cluster of very poor reservoir quality samples from which trend with good correlation between porosity and permeability extends. The cluster of poor samples has similar characteristics to samples from the Ror Formation, whereas the trend with good correlation is similar to the Ile and Tilje Formations, reaching similar reservoir qualityto the Garn Formation in number of samples. In contrast to the Garn Formation, the Not Formation has poorer reservoir qualities than that of 6507/5-2 with mean porosity of 10.17%, arithmetic mean permeability of 17.48mD and geomean permeability of 0.74mD in well 6507/5-4. The reservoir quality of the Ile Formation exhibits good positive trend between porosity and permeability, with R2=0.77. The Ile Formation includes few samples with very good reservoir quality, similar to those found in the Garn Formation, but are not numerous enough to confirm any significant reservoir potential. Generally, the reservoir characteristics of the Ile Formation are ~17% porosity and ~10 mD permeability. Interestingly, the Ile Formation has an arithmetic mean porosity (14.28%) greater than that of the Not Formation (10.17%), largely because the Ile Formation lacks the poor reservoir quality samples seen near the base of the Not Formation. similar effect is seen in permeability characteristics (31.67 mD, mD respectively). The Ror Formation is characterised by poor reservoir quality with mean porosity of 6.04%, and arithmetic mean permeability of mD. The correlation between porosity and permeability is also poor, with R2 = 0.04. The Tilje Formation is also characterised by generally poor reservoir quality (mean porosity = 16.01% and geomean permeability = mD), but displays similarly good correlation between porosity and permeability to the Ile Formation (as also seen in well 6507/5-2). The coefficient of determination is, however, less than the Ile Formation (0.57, respectively) as the formation is heterolithic to locally super heterolithic in terms of sediment fabric. 6.2.1 Primary Controls on Reservoir Quality Primary controls on reservoir quality are those related to the depositional character of the initial sediment at or just after it was deposited. These controls dictate the initial porosity and permeability values of the sediment together with initial pore geometry. These primary controls are considered as essentially facies based, and include variations in textural and mineralogical parameters such as grain size, sorting, detrital clay content and proportions of labile (unstable) grains. For example, the porosity of spherical grains of uniform size that have been randomly packed is 47.6%. Interestingly, frictional processes force given amount of coarser grains to stabilise at lower porosity than the same amount of finer grains, although the porosity associated with the finer grains may be less effective. Sorting plays similar primary role, as coarser grains in the place of finer grains remove both the volume of the grains and the intergranular porosity, whereas finer grains simply replace only the intergranular porosity between grains. The minimum occurs with proportion of approximately 20%-30% smaller grains in bimodal population, however, real rocks contain spectrum of grain sizes. The palaeoenvironment and depositional processes dictate many of these characteristics. Page 51', 'Passage_id': 692}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: These primary controls are distinct from secondary control (discussed below), which represent those processes that occur during the post-depositional history of the sediment and are related to compaction and burial diagenesis. The Lower to Middle Jurassic interval in well 6507/5-4 demonstrates that primary controls on reservoir quality are major factor in explaining variations in rock quality and that grain size and depositional environment (facies) are most important. The Garn Formation has the best reservoir qualities, as it consists of relatively clean, dominantly medium grained sandstones that form multi- storey sandbody. These features result directly from the marine, high energy, tidal sandwave system within which it was deposited. More subtle variations in reservoir quality may also have primary depositional control. For example, differential subsidence rates may result in more condensed section or more rapidly deposited sediment pile. More slower subsiding locations may allow the development of more pervasive early diagenetic cements such as siderite, which reduces reservoir quality, resulting in complex mixture of both primary and secondary controls on the preserved rock quality. The following section includes brief discussion of the main primary controls on reservoir quality as recognised in the 6507/5-4 well. Of the primary controls on reservoir quality, grain size has the most pronounced influence. Figure 6.5 illustrates the positive correlation between grain size and reservoir quality and the marked difference between the different formations in terms of modal grain size (compare with Figure 6.4). Medium and coarse-grained sandstones have notably better reservoir qualities than very fine and fine-grained sandstones. Similarly, these two groups exhibit different relationship between porosity and permeability, the medium and coarse-grained sandstones having markedly greater permeability for any given porosity. Modal grain size probably also has an inverse correlation with clay content and probably provides an explanation for the two differing trends. Both the very fine and fine-grained sandstone samples plot on similar trends and have wide range in reservoir quality, although very fine (lower) samples show no meaningful trend. Fine-upper and fine-lower samples plot on the same trend and, despite the wide range in reservoir quality, fine-upper sandstones have generally better quality than fine-lower sandstones. The large degree of overlap, however, cannot be easily explained by variations simply in grain size, which requires an alternative explanation. In contrast, the very fined grained samples exhibit notable difference in trend between the very fine (upper) and very fine (lower) samples. Very fine (upper) samples largely have the same trend as the fine-grained samples with slight cluster around poor reservoir properties, while the very fine (lower) samples simply cluster in the region of poor reservoir quality, with porosity rarely exceeding 10% and permeability only exceeding 1mD in one samples. Significant reservoir quality consequently appears to be confined to samples with modal grain size of very fine upper or coarser. Facies are, to some extent, surrogate of grain size and show clear relationship with reservoir quality. Depositional facies, however, also controls sediment fabric which, in turn impacts on the pore system and overall the rocks reservoir properties. The large number of depositional facies encountered in the study interval makes general investigation into the entire core analysis dataset problematic. It is, however, possible to investigate the facies control on reservoir quality on formation-by-formation basis. These plots illustrate the important role played by facies in controlling reservoir quality. Figure shows the core analysis of samples for the Garn Formation coded by facies and close examination and comparison with Figure (with data coded for grain size) illustrates that within the Garn Formation facies forms better means of subsetting the data than grains size alone. Petrographic data also demonstrate the importance of primary depositional controls on sandstone quality and show that ductile content, predominantly detrital mud, represents significant control on Page 52', 'Passage_id': 693}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id macroporosity, macropore size and permeability in the Jurassic formations (Table 4.7). high ductile content facilitates denser packing and thereby preferentially reduces pore volume and hence porosity. This process also reduces pore connectivity and the deleterious effect this has in narrowing pore throats is exacerbated in the finer grained and more ductile-rich sandstones. The ductile poor nature of the Garn Formation means that it has the best reservoir properties of all the Jurassic formations. The effect of sorting on reservoir quality varies between formations (Tables 4.2-4.6): in some cases poorer sorting is associated with poorer reservoir quality (e.g. in the Not Formation) whereas in others it seems to have little or even the opposite effect. Petrographic and core analysis data from the Not Formation (Table 4.4) demonstrate the importance of grain size, mud and mica content and sorting in controlling reservoir quality. Grain size and mud content are also important controls in the Ile and Tilje Formations (Tables and 4.6). 6.2.2 Secondary (Diagenetic) Controls on Reservoir Quality In the Cretaceous Lange Formation ferroan calcite cement locally has severe deleterious effect on reservoir quality. Kaolinite and siderite are less important secondary controls. Secondary or diagenetic controls on sandstone quality are also important in the Jurassic sandstones, with compaction, kaolinite, quartz and carbonates (notably ferroan dolomite and siderite) each playing part. Considering the Jurassic dataset as whole (Table 4.7), no authigenic mineral appears to have dominating influence on porosity or permeability individually. Diagenetic controls are more apparent when the Jurassic formations are analysed individually: Garn Formation In the Garn Formation (Table 4.3), kaolinite clearly has detrimental effect on reservoir quality, partly filling intergranular pores and converting former intergranular macroporosity into microporosity. Quartz overgrowth cement seems to have little effect, probably because abundances are relatively low (max. 5.33%) and it would have helped to reduce compactional porosity loss. Significant amounts of porosity have been lost due to compaction, despite the rarity of ductile components and such losses would be expected to be greater in the less well sorted sandstones. Not Formation Only four petrographic samples were analysed from the Not Formation, so the apparently strong negative correlations between authigenic mineral abundances and porosity and permeability (see Table 4.4) should be treated with caution. Kaolinite is the most abundant authigenic mineral (average 13.41%) and clearly has deleterious effect on reservoir quality. Its distribution is partly facies controlled because it is partly derived from the alteration of mica grains. Other authigenic components, such as siderite and ferroan dolomite, appear to be more abundant in finer grained facies and hence are partly facies controlled. As in the Garn, quartz overgrowth cement is not abundant (average 3.75%) and does not seem to have major deleterious effect on reservoir quality. Ile Formation Quartz overgrowth cement is on average (7.93%) the most abundant cement in the Ile Formation but its abundance is not well correlated with either helium porosity or permeability (Table 4.5) and is actually positively correlated with total macroporosity. Kaolinite (average 3.39%) shows positive correlations with porosity and permeability, partly because it is commonest in coarse sandstone. Siderite, ferroan dolomite and indeterminate, probably illitic, clays are locally abundant and show negative correlations with macroporosity, helium porosity and permeability, as would be expected. Page 53', 'Passage_id': 694}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Tilje Formation In the Tilje Formation, kaolinite is on average the commonest authigenic mineral and it has significant deleterious effect on helium porosity and permeability (Table 4.6). Although siderite locally reduces porosity, it does not seem to have much overall effect and it commonly replaces mud and grains rather than occupying former pore space. Quartz overgrowths do not seem to have major impact on reservoir quality; their abundance is actually positively correlated with permeability. Compaction is major cause of porosity loss and is likely to have had greatest deleterious effect in the less well sorted and more ductile rich facies. Secondary porosity produced by the dissolution of feldspar grains is important in the Tilje Formation and significant proportion of the macropores are secondary in origin. Correlation coefficients (Table 4.6) suggest the secondary macropores tend to be commoner and larger in the more lithic and albite-rich sandstones. 6.3 SANDBODY GEOMETRY The Lower to Middle Jurassic interval in the 6507/5-4 well contains broad range of facies deposited in variety of depositional settings, resulting in similar degree of variation in reservoir geometries. Reservoir units are expected to show marked geometric variability in both geographic and stratigraphic sense. brief summary is included here for completeness, but more detailed information on probable geometries was described in the 6507/5-1 study (RRI Report No. 8150/Id) and is implicit in the facies interpretations included in Chapter 3. Further information concerning potential sandbody geometry is included in the discussion of the reservoir zonation scheme. Brief comments on potential reservoir geometries are also included in the reservoir geological summary of Section 6.4. The geometry of sandstone bodies, in light of the 6507/5-4 well, is essentially the same as those put forward in the 6507/5-2 study and are briefly reported below. The Garn Formation is large, composite sandbody with broad, sheetlike external geometry which covers broad area of Mid Norway. In the Skarv area, the Garn Formation is interpreted as stacked series of large scale, shallow marine tidal sandwaves deposited as series of large scale compound dunes (sandwaves) with intervening intra-sandwave channels and local protected troughs. Despite the broad sheetform external geometry, internally the Garn is complex and heterogeneous and treating it as simple, extensive sand sheet may be inappropriate. At least one potentially significant surface within the Garn Formation is the locally coal-rich horizon marking the contact between Garn and Garn (JS13 and JS14). This surface may substantially compartmentalise the Garn Reservoir. The uppermost part of the Garn Formation above this surface is believed to represent sandbody that is not present in the Heidrun area to the south and is consequently expected to thin dramatically at some location to the southwest of the 6507/5-4 well, probably over distance in excess of 10 km. Other surfaces associated with changes in depositional character may also have significance for potential reservoir performance. Interpretation of the 6507/5-4 well suggests that significant thickness variations can occur in the Skarv area in response to variations in subsidence rate during deposition, although facies appear to be relatively consistent over distances of several kilometres. As whole the Garn Formation is expected to gradually thicken to the west and thin (shale out) to the east. On local scale, the greatest lateral thickness variation in the Garn Formation is expected to occur within the middle parts of the formation, although very local control, associated to specific fault, cannot be ruled out. At the finest scale, bedform geometry in the Garn Formation results in reservoir with both centimetric and Page 54', 'Passage_id': 695}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: decimetric heterogeneity that may be allied to possible discontinuities associated with the lateral scale of the compound barforms which dominate this sequence. In general, the Not Formation has limited reservoir potential, restricted to middle to upper shoreface sediments in the uppermost parts of the formation. In the 6507/5-4 well, however, the upper parts of the Not Formation are characterised by reservoir qualities similar to that of the overlying Garn Formation. This upper part of the Not Formation has sheetform geometry that is expected to be extensive for distances in excess of several tens of kilometres. Potential erosion of the uppermost part of the Not Formation at the base of the Garn Formation forms the biggest unknown when considering sandbody geometry on regional scale. It is worth pointing out, however, that the lack of significant erosion at this level in the 6507/5-4 well, despite the overall thinning of the Garn and the proposed reduced subsidence at this site, lessens the likelihood of major truncation at base Garn level in the Skarv area. This observation is further supported by the interpreted genetic association between the Not and Garn Formations. In common with the 6507/5-1 well, the best reservoir quality units within the Ile Formation of well 6507/5-4 consist of relatively thin, coarse-grained sandstones interpreted as subtidal channels and transgressive lags. These units are, however, generally thinner and less abundant than in the 6507/5-1 well. The transgressive units marking minor intraformational flooding surfaces are likely to be laterally extensive and can be correlated with confidence to the other Skarv wells, although they are commonly cemented, typically very thin and do not form significant potential reservoirs. The subtidal channel units recognised in 6507/5-1 are particularly rare in 6507/5-2 and where present are very thin. In addition, these units are likely to have laterally restricted, ribbon form external geometries, probably oriented perpendicular to the depositional strike. The main body of the Ile Formation consists of bioturbated sandstones in the 6507/5-4 well that are very much thinner than in 6507/5-1 and have particularly poor reservoir quality. These units are, however, expected to have very laterally extensive, sheetform external geometries with only very limited facies variation over distances in excess of 10 km. Reservoir uncertainty is greatest in terms of the thickness of this unit that may well have tectonic control (syn-depositional subsidence rate). The Tilje Formation is the most complex reservoir interval in the Lower to Middle Jurassic, and contains suite of sandbodies with very wide range of potential geometries. In summary, the heterolithic uppermost parts of the Tilje Formation contain relatively thin tidal channel sandbodies which are likely to have ribbon-form to laterally restricted sheetform geometries with broadly lensoidal cross sectional geometries with width of few hundred metres to approximately km. The amalgamation of several discrete channel units may produce significantly more extensive compound sandbodies but these may contain several internal permeability baffles. Minor mouthbar and lagoon/bay shoreface sandstones within the same upper part of the Tilje Formation are more likely to have lobate external geometries, with mouthbar units being more laterally restricted than lagoon/bay shorefaces. Lagoon/bay mudstones within this sequence form important local permeability barriers and are expected to be continuous for distances of few kilometres or more, but are less laterally extensive than those in middle and lower parts of the Tilje Formation, which can be traced over large parts of the Mid Norway area. The marginal marine sandstones in middle parts of the Tilje Formation form well-developed, amalgamated sandbody with very extensive sheetform geometry, but are separated by equally extensive mudstone units. On regional scale, these marine sandbodies are expected to pass transitionally into heterolithic sediments similar to those of upper parts of the Tilje Formation Page 55', 'Passage_id': 696}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: towards the southwest. Lower parts of the Tilje Formation have generally low reservoir quality, although sandbodies in this part of the succession are laterally extensive. 6.4 RESERVOIR GEOLOGY SUMMARY 6.4.1 Melke Formation The Melke Formation is uncored in the 6507/5-4 well and has no significant reservoir potential in the Skarv area. The Melke is dominated by mudstones, possibly with minor component of very fine- grained argillaceous sandstones, and forms regionally extensive seal to reservoirs in the underlying succession. To the north of the Skarv area, lower parts of the Melke locally contain progradational wedges of sandstone that were derived from the north. These sandstones do not, however, extend much further south than the Norne Field. Weakly progradational log signatures within lower parts of the Melke Formation in the Skarv area may be distal equivalent of these progradational wedges. 6.4.2 Garn Formation The Garn Formation within well 6507/5-4 is characterised by good reservoir quality, with mean porosity of 17.89%, an arithmetic permeability of mD and geometric mean of mD. Interestingly, this porosity is less than that seen in well 6507/5-2, whereas the permeabilities are greater. This formation has by far the best reservoir qualities encountered in the study well and is good throughout. However, the Garn Formation is internally heterogeneous with slight variations in reservoir quality due to changes in facies and reservoir architecture. Detailed facies description and correlation of the Garn Facies suggest that the interval as whole is likely to be laterally extensive with sheetform external geometry. However, there is potential for significant thickness variations over distances of few kilometres, particularly in response to syn-depositional variations and subsidence rates. In addition, there is potential for lateral pinch-out of the upper parts of the Garn Formation to the south of the Skarv area, although the minimal variation between 6507/5-4 and the other Skarv wells suggests that this may occur over significantly greater distance than the well spacing and potentially at some location beyond the licence boundary. Regionally, the local presence of bitumen staining within the Garn Formation may suggest relatively complex history of hydrocarbon emplacement. It is possible that relatively early hydrocarbon charge could be partially responsible for the preservation of excellent reservoir quality, although no such bitumen staining was seen in the study well. The greatest uncertainty concerning the reservoir potential of the Garn Formation at the field scale is possible variations in the degree of cementation of gross rock volume rather than continuity of the sandbody. 6.4.3 Not Formation The Not Formation has mean core analysis porosity of 10.17%, an arithmetic permeability of 17.48 mD and geometric mean permeability of mD. As reflected by the differences between the arithmetic and geometric mean permeablities, the Not Formation is characterised by extremely variable reservoir quality and is primarily controlled by the depositional facies of the sediment. Importantly, the Garn Facies seen at the base of JS11 in 6507/5-2 is not present in this well, although slightly coarser interval is seen at the appropriate depth and may represent the distal equivalent of this unit. The lower part of the Not Formation is mud prone, as seen in wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 and is effectively non-reservoir with some potential for mudstones at its base. These mudstones have the potential to behave as barriers to flow and the difference seen between the diagnosed oil-water contact and that seen in well 6507/5-4 suggests that that is the case. The mudstone interval is Page 56', 'Passage_id': 697}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: regional in extent and occurs across the entire Skarv area. Potential reservoir units within most of the Not Formation are expected to be extremely laterally extensive and were deposited as part of an elongate, linear shoreface system. Higher potential is, however, associated with the presence of coarser-grained shoreface sediments in upper parts of the formation. These units are expected to be elongate, linear in external geometry. 6.4.4 Ile Formation In common with both the previous Skarv wells, the Ile Formation has poor reservoir quality in well 6507/5-4 as direct result of the primary depositional facies that is dominated by intensely bioturbated shelfal sandstones. Subsequently, the core analysis dataset for the Ile Formation has low mean porosity of 14.28%; however, the data set also has arithmetic permeability of mD and geometric permeability of mD, which is greater than the overlying Not Formation and the Ile Formation in well 6507/5-2 (mean porosity = 13.6%, arithmetic mean = mD and geometric mean = mD). This is, however, poor compared with the Garn Formation. Similarly to well 6507/5-2, the best reservoir quality is seen in the middle to lower parts of the formation. The Ile Formation locally contains thin, coarse-grained units with good reservoir quality, that were initially interpreted as local, coarse-grained lags of small channel bedload, however, simple comparison with the other Skarv wells reveals that these lags can be correlated with confidence suggesting more regional, transgressive lag interpretation. These variations in facies produce heterogeneous porosity and permeability profile that may have implications for production in adjacent areas if the Ile was improved and hydrocarbon bearing. The progradational unit seen in well 6507/5-1 is very thin in the study well, similar to that seen in 6507/5-2. This is result of depositional condensing. The base of the Ile Formation in the study well is extraordinary. The unit is extremely condensed with pervasive carbonate cements, pyrite, floating ooids and is notably glauconitic. This early diagenetic cementation and condensing is result of the Ile Formation being distal, offshore facies, equivalent to the more proximal facies seen to the south in the Heidrun area. As consequence, it is possible that the reservoir quality of the Ile Formation as whole will increase to the south and west of the study well, however this improvement is likely to be beyond the prospective area. 6.4.5 Ror Formation The Ror Formation is dominated by sandy mudstones and bioturbated, argillaceous, very fine-grained sandstones and is consequently non-reservoir in character. The formation has mean porosity of 6.04% and an arithmetic mean permeability of only mD with maximum measured permeability of only mD. The formation is regionally extensive and forms potential seal to reservoirs in the underlying Tilje Formation, although the sealing potential of the unit on geological time scale is questionable. In common with the other Skarv wells, the study well contains no evidence of the Tofte sands that are encountered at this stratigraphic level in the Smrbukk area to the south. The rapid pinch out and westerly source of these units further south suggests that their occurrence to the west of the study area cannot be entirely ruled out, although such an occurrence in the immediate Skarv area is thought highly unlikely. 6.4.6 Tilje Formation The Tilje Formation within the study well is not entirely cored, ending within the upper half of the Tilje Zone. The cored interval has mean porosity of 16.01%, which is very similar to that seen in the other two Skarv wells. The arithmetic mean permeability of mD and geometric mean of 3.36 mD are more similar to those seen in 6507/5-1 rather than 6507/5-2. The notable differences between the arithmetic and geometric mean permeabilities reflect the heterogeneity seen within the Tilje Formation as whole. The reservoir quality differences previously seen between well 6507/5-1 Page 57', 'Passage_id': 698}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id and 6507/5-2 within the Tilje Formation were initially explained using greater burial depth and the degree of formational condensing in the 6507/5-2 well. This explanation still stands true and it is in fact the occurrence of Reservoir Zone JS6.8 in the 6507/5-4 well that produces this pseudo-similarity with well 6507/5-1. Reservoir Zone JS6.8 is coarse-grained facies association of shelfal sediments, occurring just below the boundary with the overlying Ror Formation and alone has mean porosity of 17.89% and arithmetic permeability of 201.84mD, skewing the mean porosities and permeabilities for the Tilje Formation as whole. In summary, the depositional facies for the three Skarv wells are broadly similar and the thinning is interpreted as syn-depositional in nature and implies longer residence time at or near the sediment surface for each package. This factor provides the potential for more intense early diagenetic cementation and for processes such as clay infiltration to adversely affect the pore network. Of further significance is the slightly greater burial depth of the Tilje Formation in 6507/5-4. The greater depth of burial may be associated with slightly elevated temperatures and pressures resulting in more intense late diagenetic cementation. The middle parts of the Tilje have super heterolithic character and consist of interbedded sandstones and thin mudstones, commonly with strong tidal signature. Vertical permeabilities are likely to be at least an order of magnitude lower than horizontal permeabilities and many of the mudstone intervals in this part of the formation form laterally extensive permeability barriers or baffles. Below the heterolithic upper section, an increased marine influence has resulted in slightly more homogeneous character to the Tilje that contains number of relatively thick sandbodies representing stacked, marginal marine to slightly restricted marine shoreface. Reservoir quality in this interval varies as result of grain size and variations in the degree of bioturbation but is generally less variable than in the overlying heterolithic sediments. Mudstones within this interval are extremely laterally continuous and are likely to have field-wide extent. Regional evidence based on detailed correlation suggests that the more homogeneous sediments of Zone Tilje will pass transitionally into more heterolithic sediments similar to those in the upper parts of the Tilje Formation towards the south and southwest of the 6507/5-4 well. Lower parts of the Tilje Formation have not been cored in the 6507/5-4 well but close correlation can be made between the log signatures in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and broadly similar facies are expected. 6.4.7 re Formation The re Formation is uncored in the 6507/5-4 well, but log signatures suggest similar facies pattern to that developed in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells with number of isolated, relatively clean sandstones forming potential reservoir units. 6.5 RESERVOIR ZONATION The reservoir zonation scheme erected during the 6507/5-1 study was applied to the new well and minor modifications made where necessary. The reservoir zonation was undertaken during detailed discussions between BP Amoco and RRI. series of surfaces were identified, which formed the basis for erection of reservoir zonation scheme of the Lower and Middle Jurassic specific to the Skarv area. The reservoir zones are listed below and further detailed together with mean reservoir properties in Tables and 6.3. Page 58', 'Passage_id': 699}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: ZONE TOP (m dd) BASE (m dd) JS14 JS13 JS12 JS11 JS10 JS9 JS8 JS7 JS6 JS5 JS4 The criteria for recognition of these zones and their sedimentological and reservoir geological characteristics are briefly outlined below. 6.5.1 Zone JS15 This zone is uncored in well 6507/5-4 but is interpreted as an Aalenian mudstone unit directly overlying the Garn and is equivalent to the Not unit of RRI (see Chapter 5). The base coincides with the top of the Garn and is picked at an abrupt decrease in gamma associated with the change in lithology. This surface may be disconformable to unconformable in nature but no significant time gap is implied. The top of Zone JS15 is more difficult to pick in the 6507/5-4 well. 6.5.2 Zone JS14 Zone JS14 corresponds to the upper part of the Garn and is equivalent to the Garn unit of the RRI regional scheme described in Chapter 5. The basal surface is poorly defined on well logs but is very well defined in core. The basal surface marks an abrupt change in facies from variably structured and locally massive sandstones below to well structured, small scale cross bedded sandstones above. Variations in colouration and cementation are also associated with this surface and in 6507/5-4 the basal surface is overlain by sandstones containing abundant carbonaceous debris. The zone has thickness of 32m (compared to 23m in 6507/5-1) and the lower half of the zone is cored, with mean porosity of 17.86% (18.08% in 6507/5-2) and arithmetic mean permeability of mD. It is difficult to accurately predict the lateral continuity of Zone JS14 to the southwestern extreme of the Skarv area, but the only limited thinning between the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells and small amount of thickening contrasts with that observed in the underlying zone and may suggest either that this interval was deposited in relatively short time span or that the local variations in subsidence rate suggested for Zone JS13 had reduced by the time the JS14 unit was deposited. The nature of the basal surface and the evident change in facies suggests potentially significant partition between Zone JS14 and JS13. 6.5.3 Zone JS13 Zone JS13 occurs in middle parts of the Garn Formation and corresponds to the upper part of the Garn unit above the gravel-rich sandstones. The top surface is very sharp and is picked on the top of the new reservoir subzone of JS13.9. The base is defined as the top of the coarsening upwards Page 59', 'Passage_id': 700}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: unit in lower parts of the Garn and marks change from relatively coarse grained and locally granular sandstones below to more homogeneous and better-sorted sandstones above. Sandstones in Zone JS13 are poorly structured to locally massive, medium grained and typically clean, and were deposited as part of large, active, tidal sandwave system. The zone is 15.85m thick in the 6507/5-4 well, in contrast to an 18m thickness in the 5-1 well, with the thinning interpreted to represent syn- depositional thinning in response largely to variations in local subsidence rate. The zone is entirely cored and has mean porosity of 17.3% and arithmetic mean permeability of mD, showing similar porosity but reduced permeability to the overlying Zone JS14. The reservoir quality of this zone is slightly less than that seen in the 6507/5-1 well but markedly lower permeability (20.8% and 1827 mD in 6507/5-1). Most of the thickness variation of the Garn between the 6507/5-1 and 6507/6-2 wells is accommodated in the overlying JS14 zone, but between these wells and the 6507/5-4 and 6507/5-2 wells it is Zone JS13 that accommodates most of the thickness variation. The zone is expected to thicken towards the west and southwest, although no abrupt changes are expected on scale of few kilometres. Reservoir quality is extremely good and despite slightly lower mean permeabilities than Zones J12 or J14, the measured permeabilities have significantly lower standard deviation than Zone J12 and, as result of the relatively homogeneous nature of much of the interval, smaller contrast between vertical and horizontal permeabilities is expected. Potential uncertainty within this zone consists of the possibility of lateral facies variations. The lower part of the zone in the 6507/5-1 well has slightly finer grained, more heterogeneous and more intensely bioturbated character with consequently reduced reservoir quality. This interval represents facies developed at the margins of a major sandwave system and it remains possible that other such intervals may occur elsewhere in the Skarv area. In addition, unique facies for the Garn Formation is recognised at the top of Zone JS13 in the study well, constituting newly defined Subzone JS13.9 with top coinciding with the top of Garn 1. The top of the zone is picked on the base of minor intra-sandwave channel containing high concentration of carbonaceous fragments. The base of the unit is picked at thin mudstone at approximately 3544m dd, which is potentially correlated to the coal observed in 6507/5-2. This interpretation would suggest that the high angle sandwave sediments which dominate Subzone JS13.9 have been entirely removed (or never deposited) in the two previous Skarv wells. This interpretation is compounded by palynology data. Large numbers of Deltoidospora spp. found within the mudstone suggest the presence of swamp macroflora, and thus coeval swamps and coal forming environments and the mudstone contains no significant marine markers The intra-sandwave channel that marks the top of this subzone represents the erosion surface that may be responsible for the removal of this subzone in wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2. 6.5.4 Zone JS12 Reservoir Zone JS12 forms the lower part of the Garn Formation and represents coarsening upwards sequence of medium to coarse grained sandstones capped by sequence with locally common granules. This unit is correlated with confidence to the JS12 zone in the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells, although extraformational granules and pebbles are generally less common than in these more northerly wells. The base of the zone corresponds with the base of the Garn Formation and is well defined both in core and on the logs, by an abrupt change in depositional facies and grain size. The zone has mean porosity of 19.27% and an arithmetic mean permeability of mD, making this the second best reservoir zone in the study well, although this is still significantly poorer than the same interval in the 6507/5-1 where the mean porosity and permeability were 21.7% and Page 60', 'Passage_id': 701}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 3011 mD respectively. The finer grain size in lower parts of the zone is associated with poorer rock quality and overall reservoir performance is also likely to be adversely affected by the presence of thin argillaceous and micaceous laminae that may reduce vertical connectivity of the reservoir. further observation is that much of Zone JS12 consists of well structured, cross bedded sandstones which are broadly similar to those of Reservoir Zone JS14 and may have broadly similar reservoir performance. The zone as whole is expected to be laterally extensive and to occur over the entire 6.5.5 Zone JS11 Zone JS11 represents the upper part of the Not Formation, with top defined by the base of the Garn Formation and base defined by relatively abrupt change in grain size and facies, with finer grained shoreface sandstones of the upper part of Zone JS10 below and cross bedded, medium to coarse grained sandstones above. This reservoir zone is somewhat different from the same stratigraphic level in the 6507/5-2 well, and lacks the well defined Garn like interval of relatively coarse-grained sandstones seen in 6507/5-2. The uppermost part of the zone is, however, very similar to the JS11 Zone in 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2. As result, the bipartite division of the reservoir zone in 6507/5-2 is not present in the study well and the whole interval is assigned to the JS11 zone. The zone as whole has an average porosity of 14.52% and an arithmetic mean permeability of 55.22 mD which, although significantly poorer than the main body of the Garn, still represents moderately good quality reservoir relative to all underlying intervals in the well. It has been noted that the Not sandstones in JS11 have lower porosity in the 6507/5-2 well than in the 6507/5-1 well but have similar permeability. This difference derives directly from the presence of the Garn facies unit in the 6507/5-2 well and direct comparison between the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells is not comparison of like for like. Equally this interval within the study well represents the distal coeval equivalent to the Garn like facies in 6507/5-2. 6.5.6 Zone JS10 The middle and lower parts of the Not Formation are assigned to Reservoir Zone JS10 and have poor reservoir quality throughout. As whole, the zone has an average porosity of 8.64% and arithmetic mean permeability of only mD. The zone is entirely cored and the low reservoir quality in 6507/5-4 is characteristic of this stratigraphic interval. The zone is 24.4m thick and can be divided into three subzones (JS10.3, JS10.5 and JS10.7 from base to top) that can be correlated with confidence to other Skarv wells. Reservoir quality is poor in all three zones, although the uppermost interval (Subzone JS10.7) is dominated by relatively clean shoreface sandstones in which reservoir quality is adversely affected by the very fine grain size, the presence of thin but abundant argillaceous and micaceous drapes and laminae, and patchy carbonate cementation. The zone as whole is expected to be very laterally continuous, with only limited potential for improvement in reservoir quality. Page 61', 'Passage_id': 702}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 6.5.7 Zone JS9 Reservoir Zone JS9 forms the upper part of the Ile Formation, including all of Ile and most of Ile 3. The top of the zone corresponds to the top of the Ile Formation that, in common with the 6507/5-2 well, represents slightly ambiguous pick within transitional facies of argillaceous bioturbated sandstones. The base of the zone is high confidence correlative surface marking minor but probably widespread relative flooding surface. As already noted, the Ile Formation in the 6507/5-4 well has poor reservoir quality and this is reflected in the core analysis averages for this zone, with mean porosity of 11.89% and particularly low arithmetic mean permeability of only mD. Four subzones are recognised (JS9.2, JS9.4, JS9.6 and JS9.8) which resemble small-scale progradational parasequences and are defined by minor relative flooding surfaces in core but are not clearly seen on the logs. In contrast with the 6507/5-1 well, Subzone JS9.6 has the best reservoir quality in this interval, although mean porosity of 15.41% and mean permeability of only mD indicate the poor overall rock quality. As noted in discussions above, the Ile Formation is very thin in the 6507/5-4 well as result of depositional thinning and condensing. Reservoir quality, even in more expanded intervals of the Ile Formation, is expected to be poor in the Skarv area due to the dominance of offshore shelfal facies with intense bioturbation. In the 6507/5-4 well, this initially poor reservoir quality is further compromised by the condensing and associated abundance of early diagenetic cements. 6.5.8 Zone JS8 The lower parts of the Ile Formation are assigned to Reservoir Zone JS8 that includes all of Zones Ile 1, Ile and the lowermost part of Zone Ile as defined in Section 5.3.5. The base is defined as the base of the Ile Formation that coincides with the base of relatively clean stacked sandbody as seen previously in both the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 wells. This zone consists of lower coarsening and cleaning upwards sequence capped by thin lag of cemented sandstone intraclasts (Subzone JS8.3), overlain by thinner, more heterolithic coarsening upwards sequence (Subzone JS8.7). The zone as a whole has mean porosity of 15.30% with an arithmetic mean permeability of only mD. In the 6507/5-1 well this zone has greater average porosity (18.36%) but was significantly thicker and had higher permeability of mD. The depositional thinning and condensing is thought to be largely responsible for this reduced reservoir quality, probably resulting in both increased mixing from bioturbation and differences in cement and clay character. 6.5.9 Zone JS7 Reservoir Zone JS7 constitutes the entirety of the Ror Formation and is non-reservoir in character, reflecting the very fine grained, argillaceous and intensely bioturbated nature of the Ror Formation. A detailed series of subzones is recognised which match the stratigraphic zonation of the Ror Formation in wells 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2, but are less well constrained in the study well. The Ror Formation as whole may act as seal to reservoirs in the underlying Tilje Formation. 6.5.10 Zone JS6 Reservoir Zone JS6 represents the uppermost part of the Tilje Formation and corresponds to both the Tilje unit defined in Section 5.3.6 and Tilje 6. The top of the zone is picked at the top of the Tilje Formation that in the 6507/5-4 well corresponds to the top of Tilje 6. The base of the reservoir zone is picked at well-defined facies change marking change from more homogenous marginal marine sandstones below to heterolithic and restricted lagoon/bay sediments above. Reservoir Zone JS6 has a mean porosity of 16.42% and an arithmetic mean permeability of only mD. Page 62', 'Passage_id': 703}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id The zone can be subdivided into three subzones, with Subzone JS6.8 corresponding to the possible Toarcian sandstone of RRI Zone Tilje 6. The fourth subzone recognised in 6507/5-1 (JS6.9) is absent in the 6507/5-4 well. Mudstone units within the zone as whole may act as minor barriers to production and are likely to be extensive on scale of several kilometres. Regional evidence discussed in separate report suggests that some of these relatively thin units may be continuous over very broad area. 6.5.11 Zone JS5 Reservoir Zone JS5 has generally poor reservoir quality in the 6507/5-4 well and corresponds to the middle and upper parts of Zone Tilje 4, consisting of stacked marginal marine shoreface sandstones with variable fine grain size. The base of the zone is picked at the base of sandstone unit (3715.11m dd) and does not correspond with the base of the Tilje unit (which is picked slightly lower at the base of mudstone unit at 3718.07m dd). The zone as whole has an average measured porosity of 16.02% and an arithmetic mean permeability of mD. These values contrast markedly with those of Reservoir Zone JS5 in the 6507/5-1 well, where middle parts of the interval contained sandstones with permeabilities consistently greater than 100 mD and reaching maximum of in excess of 500mD. This difference is partly accounted for by finer grain size, higher argillaceous content and more intense bioturbation in the 6507/5-4 well, but difference in cementation associated with greater burial depth cannot be ruled out. The unit as whole is expected to be laterally continuous with an extensive sheetform external geometry, although this zone also shows some thinning in response to the reduced subsidence interpreted at the 6507/5-4 well location, relative to the 6507/5-1 well. Correlation on regional basis carried out as part of the 6507/5-1 and 6507/5-2 studies suggested that the unit might become more heterolithic towards the southwest, where it was expected to pass progressively into more heterolithic facies similar to those of the overlying sediments of Reservoir Zone JS6. This pattern appears to be confirmed by the nature of Reservoir Zone JS5 encountered in the study well. Two subzones are recognised, JS5.3 in lower and middle parts and JS5.7 at the top. The subzones are separated by thin lagoonal mudstone containing well defined shrinkage cracks. 6.5.12 Zone JS4 Reservoir Zone JS4 is only partially cored in the 6507/5-4 well, and corresponds to the upper part of Zone Tilje and the lowermost part of Zone Tilje 4. The base of the reservoir zone is picked at gamma spike in the uncored interval which corresponds to mudstone unit within Tilje that can be correlated on sub-regional scale but cannot be traced to the Heidrun area or to the 6507/3-1 well to the north. The top of the zone marks the top of laterally extensive mudstone unit, although the mudstone that marks the base of Subzone JS4.7 (the upper of two subzones defined within this reservoir zone) can be traced with more confidence over wider area and may mark stratigraphically significant surface. In the 6507/5-4 well, the zone has mean porosity of 14.57% (15.9% in the 6507/5-1 well) and particularly low arithmetic mean permeability of only mD. These values partly reflect the fact that only the upper, more argillaceous part of the reservoir zone is cored. 6.5.13 Zone JS3 Reservoir Zone JS3 is uncored in the 6507/5-4 well but is clearly defined on the logs. This reservoir zone corresponds to the lower parts of Zone Tilje and the uppermost part of Zone Tilje 2, with the base of the zone picked primarily on the basis of reservoir quality. Regional correlation suggests that the base Tilje surface may mark sequence boundary and there is some evidence in the Mid Page 63', 'Passage_id': 704}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norway area for erosion and incision of this surface into underlying sediments. The top of the zone is picked on the top of the mudstone unit marking the base of Reservoir Zone JS4. Three subzones are picked (JS3.3, JS3.5 and JS3.7), the upper consisting of cleaner marine shoreface sandstones (probably with bioturbated character) top by more argillaceous unit, the middle subzone is essentially the same as JS3.7 and the lower of restricted lagoon bay sediments. 6.5.14 Zone JS2 Reservoir Zone JS2 marks the lowermost interval of the Tilje Formation and is uncored in the 6507/5-4 well. The zone is, however, clearly defined on the logs and is expected to consist of an internally heterolithic interval containing variably marine influenced lagoon/bay mudstones, restricted marginal marine sandstones, lagoon bay shoreface sediments and minor open marine, bioturbated sediments. The base of the zone corresponds to the base of the Tilje Formation. 6.5.15 Zone JS1 Reservoir Zone JS1 was the lowermost cored interval in the 6507/5-1 well but is uncored in 6507/5-4. The zone represents the uppermost part of the re Formation, with the top of the zone marking the contact between the re and Tilje Formations. The base of the zone is placed at the base of re 3. Logs over the penetrated interval suggest that the zone is dominated by mudstones, with only relatively thin sandstones, and has no significant reservoir potential. The upper part of the zone is believed to be equivalent to the re Shale unit that is informally recognised in the Heidrun and Smrbukk areas.

A3.1 Alluvial/Delta Plain Sediments (CA) A3.1.1 Distributary Channel Sediments (CA1) Distributary channel sediments are subdivided into active (CA1a) and abandoned (CA1b) types. Active distributary channel sediments are far more common than abandoned channels and consist most commonly of medium to coarse grained sandstones. These sandstones are typically moderately well to poorly sorted, variably pebbly, cross bedded and may contain mudclasts and woody debris. In vertical section, active distributary channel sediments tend to have sharp to strongly erosive bases and have blocky to fining upwards profiles. Log responses for Facies CA1a typically consist of low gamma ray values with good positive FDC/CNL separation which may reduce upwards. Individual channel sandbodies range in thickness from <1m to >10m, and may locally stack to form thick compound sandbodies. Abandoned channel sediments (CA1b) are relatively rare and represent the generally passive accumulation of sediment in an incompletely filled channel profile. Such sequences are notoriously difficult to recognise in core and rely on the recognition of an erosive channel base. The sediment filling the channel feature can be variable, but most commonly consists of vertically accreted mudstones and overbank sediments. thin veneer of more active channel fill sediments may cover the basal erosive surface. Distributary channels occur in alluvial, delta top and delta front settings and are associated with confining levees, overbank sediments and genetically related crevasse channels and crevasse splays. The lateral extent of distributary channels is controlled by complex interplay of channel size, sinuosity, substrate and subsidence rate and may consequently be highly variable. Distributary channels are described more fully with respect to the individual constituent formations of the present study in later sections.', 'Passage_id': 712}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A3.1.2 Levee Sediments (CA2) Levees represent the topographic highs on the margins of channels, which confine the active channel width. They are defined as geomorphic element and are consequently difficult to recognise with confidence in the subsurface. In essence, however, levees represent the most proximal overbank sediments and may be expected to be generally coarser grained than most overbank sediments, but lack the well defined crevasse splay sandstones which occur in the interchannel areas. Such crevasse splays are likely to be channelised where they cut the levee and prevented from deposition on the topographic highs of the levees themselves. Because of their topographic expression, levees tend to be better drained than adjacent sediments. In highly waterlogged settings, this can result in preferential colonisation by vegetation and the development of rooted sediments. A3.1.3 Crevasse Channel Sediments (CA3) Crevasse channels are those channels which directly feed unconfined or poorly confined crevasse splays, and represent scoured and channelised breaches in channel confining levees. Crevasse channels are essentially small distributary channels and with time any individual crevasse channel may evolve into true distributary channel. Crevasse channels are represented by fine to coarse grained sandstones which are broadly comparable to those for the active distributary channel sediments described above, although they are characterised by more flashy discharge regime of both water and sediment. This may be recorded in more heterogeneous but generally finer grained fill than the main distributary channels. In addition, crevasse channels can be recognised by their relationship with coeval crevasse splay sandstones in terms of both size and sediment character. Proximal (CA3a) and distal (CA3b) crevasse channel sediments may be locally differentiated, with the former being generally coarser, more tightly confined and having more erosive basal scours. A3.1.4 Minor Mouthbar Sediments (CA4) Minor mouthbar sediments are subdivided into proximal (CA4a) and distal (CA4b) types. Mouthbars are deposited where channelised systems pass into bodies of standing water. The consequent expansion of the flows results in reduced current velocity and deposition of sediment as discrete barform. In the context of the present study, minor mouthbars are defined as those features which are most likely related to single channel and have thickness in the order of 1m to 10m. Such mouthbars typically consist of very fine to medium grained sandstones in proximal areas passing distally into finer grained and more thinly bedded sediments and eventually into the background sediments of the standing water body. Progradation of this proximal to distal sequence results in coarsening upwards vertical profile which may be erosively capped by channel sediments. Mouthbar sediments are generally dominated by current-related structures rather than wave reworking. The log response of this facies typically consists of an upwards reducing gamma ray and a positive FDC/CNL crossover with the separation increasing upwards. Where thicker sequences are developed, the lower parts may be assigned to Facies CA4b and the upper part to Facies CA4a. A3.1.5 Crevasse Splay Sandstones (CA5) Crevasse splay sandstones are discrete, relatively thin units of very fine to medium grained sandstone which are deposited as sheetform units from decelerating unconfined or poorly confined flows originating from breaches in an adjacent channel levee. Such units pass proximally into crevasse channels and are initially erosive in proximal areas and aggradational in more distal areas. Single crevasse splay sandstones are typically decimetric in thickness (up to maximum of ~1m thick) but several crevasse splays may stack to form considerably thicker sandbodies. Both bed thickness and erosive ability allow the differentiation of proximal (Facies CA5a) and distal (Facies CA5b) units.', 'Passage_id': 713}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Progradation of crevasse system can result in coarsening and thickening upwards vertical sequence differentiated from mouthbar by the discrete nature of individual crevasse events. Crevasse splays typically occur in subaerial or very shallow water settings and have significantly higher width to thickness ratio than comparable mouthbar sequences. A3.1.6 Floodplain/Lacustrine Sediments (CA6) The background sedimentation in non-channel alluvial and delta plain environments is dominated by relatively passive deposition of predominantly fine grained sediment. This facies is subdivided into sand-rich (Facies CA6a) and mud-rich (Facies CA6b) floodplain/lacustrine sediments. The mud-rich sediments of Facies CA6b dominate this grouping and consist of mudstones and sandy mudstones deposited primarily by vertical accretion of sediment from suspension, typically following flood events which inundated the floodplain. These muddy sediments are variably laminated and may contain root traces and desiccation features in largely subaerial settings and well developed lamination in deeper ?lacustrine settings. These sediments are commonly interbedded with thin crevasse sandstones, coals and palaeosols. In areas near to active channel systems the floodplain sediments may contain significantly higher proportion of sand and are assigned to Facies CA6a. The log response of these sediments is variable but typical mudstone response, with relatively high gamma ray values and negative FDC/CNL crossover, is usual. A3.1.7 Peatswamp Deposits (CA7) Facies CA7 consists of coals formed as in situ accumulations of organic debris in peatswamp setting. Coals which are preserved in situ typically overlie fine grained floodplain sediments in which evidence of rooting is visible. Such peatswamp deposits can be erosively ripped up or become otherwise detached from the substrate and be transported out of the peatswamp environment as drifted coals. Coals of the latter type typically have very sharp basal contacts which show no evidence of rooting at their base. The log response of coals is variable but they typically have very low density values (locally as low as g/cm3), with isolated peaks which do not form part of consistent sequence. A3.1.8 Palaeosols (CA8) Palaeosols are fossilised soil profiles and as such are not depositional facies in the true sense but represent syn-depositional or post-depositional alteration of the substrate. The presence of root traces within sediment is an indication of at least incipient soil formation. This facies type is, however, reserved for intervals in which pedogenesis (soil formation) has proceeded to greater degree, either as result of intense root activity or other soil related processes. In such situations recognition of the primary depositional origin of the sediment may be partially or completely obscured by the pedogenic activity and the interval is assigned to this facies type. In the context of the present study, palaeosols are largely limited to the intervals immediately below in situ coals which are commonly termed seatearths and have bleached pale colour with abundant root traces. A3.2 LAGOONAL/ESTUARINE SEDIMENTS (CB) A3.2.1 Tidal Channel/Shoal Sediments (CB1) Tidal sandwave sediments of Facies CB1c-CB1g are recognised almost exclusively in the Garn Formation and are discussed in Section A3.4.2.', 'Passage_id': 714}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: This facies grouping is divided into tidal channel sediments (Facies CB1a) and tidal shoal sediments (Facies CB1b), both consisting of fine to coarse grained, moderately to well sorted sandstones deposited in marginal marine to shallow marine settings. Tidal channel sediments are dominated by sandstones with similar characteristics to the distributary channel sandstones described above (Facies CA1a) but are intimately associated with tidal flat and lagoon/bay sediments in marginal marine setting. Although the recognition of tidal channels relies to some degree on association with other facies, they can generally be differentiated from fluvial channels in other ways. The repeated reworking that occurs in tidal channels often results in cleaner sandstone which is better sorted than fluvial channel sands and lacks the large woody fragments which are common in the latter. Tidal channels also tend to be thinner than their fluvial counterparts and may contain ichnofauna (trace fossils) associated with marginal marine to marine settings. Tidal shoal sediments (Facies CB1b) have similar sediment texture to tidal channels but represent aggradational barforms rather than the scour-fill geometry of channels. Current ripple cross lamination, planar lamination and low angle cross bedding dominate these sequences, in contrast to the reactivation surfaces, trough cross bedding and planar-tabular cross bedding which dominate tidal channel sandstones. Tidal shoals typically have coarsening upwards profiles, resulting from an upward increase in current activity probably representing shallowing (shoaling). The differentiation of tidal channels from tidal shoals is often difficult within inshore tidal environments (Hunter et al., 1979; Terwindt, 1981), although they are more clearly differentiated in more offshore, subtidal settings. A3.2.2 Tidal Creek Sediments (CB2) Tidal creek sediments are represented by small scale, heterolithic, fining upwards intervals associated with tidal flat sediments of Facies CB3, and are typically thin (1m-3m thick) with sharp to erosive bases locally overlain by concentrations of small mudclasts. Mud drapes are common within these units and mud-lined burrows may also occur. Tidal creek sediments represent the deposits of small channels draining tidal flat areas. Such channels are largely unconnected to the main fluvial channel systems and consequently lack the coarser sediment and woody debris sourced from major channels. Tidal creek sediments are, therefore, internally draining channels with limited lateral extent and isolated within tidal flat sediments. A3.2.3 Tidal Flat Sediments (CB3) Tidal flat sediments are subdivided into sand-rich (Facies CB3a) and mud-rich (Facies CB3b) sequences. Sand-rich tidal flat sediments are dominated by very fine to fine grained, variably argillaceous and micaceous sandstones (>50% sandstone), whereas the mud-rich variety is dominated by silty and sandy mudstones with only minor sandstone interbeds and laminae (<50%). Both facies are characterised by the thinly interbedded nature of the sediment, with preserved sedimentary structures including current and wave ripple cross lamination with abundant muddy drapes and preserved ripple form sets. Soft sediment deformation, bioturbation and rare desiccation/synaeresis cracks may also be present. These facies represent sedimentation in low relief tidal flat setting where water depths were very shallow and variable and where rapid fluctuations in energy level were common. Desiccation features are typically more common in the mud-rich sediments of Facies CB3b, largely as result of substrate controls. Tidal flats are typically drained by minor systems of tidal creeks (Facies CB2) and may be closely associated with lagoon/bay shoreface and mouthbar sediments.', 'Passage_id': 715}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A3.2.4 Lagoon/Bay Shoreface Sediments (CB4) Lagoon/bay shoreface sediments represent those deposits formed on the margins of relatively extensive lagoons or bays with variably restricted access to the open sea. The restricted nature of lagoons and bays results in lower energy and often finer grained shoreface systems than those developed in fully marine settings. Shoreface systems of this type also tend to be relatively thinly developed and show more rapid proximal to distal transitions than their fully marine counterparts. Three subfacies are recognised within this grouping:  Proximal Lagoon/Bay Shoreface Sediments (CB4a)  Distal Lagoon/Bay Shoreface Sediments (CB4b)  Minor Mouthbar Sediments (CB4c) Facies CB4a represents the more proximal (landward) parts of linear shoreface systems and is characterised by fine to medium grained, argillaceous and micaceous sandstones. These sandstones contain abundant muddy and micaceous drapes and are commonly planar laminated and undulose low angle cross laminated indicating deposition above fair weather wave base. These sequences commonly form the upper parts of well defined coarsening upwards sequences. The distal equivalent (Facies CB4b) is broadly similar but is characterised by finer grained and generally more argillaceous sandstones interbedded with greater proportion of mudstones and with sedimentary structures indicating deposition largely below fair weather wave base. This facies represents the more offshore parts of linear lagoon/bay shoreface systems and, where these systems prograde, forms the lower parts of coarsening upwards profiles. Facies CB4b is commonly interbedded with the background lagoon/bay fill sediments. Minor mouthbar sediments of Facies CB4c represent point sourced lagoon/bay shoreface systems developed where channel system supplies sediment directly to variably restricted marine influenced water body. These mouthbars have well developed coarsening upwards profiles and typically show evidence of rapid sedimentation and progradation, allowing them to be clearly differentiated from other lagoon/bay shoreface facies. A3.2.5 Lagoon/Bay Fill Sediments (CB5) Lagoon/bay fill sediments represent deposition within relatively permanent bodies of standing water with variable but often appreciable marine influence. Sand-rich (Facies CB5a) and mud-rich (Facies CB5b) varieties are recognised. Mud-rich lagoon bay sediments are deposited primarily by low energy vertical accretion of sediment by suspension settling in water depths below fair weather wave base. The restricted marine nature of the water body is often indicated by the presence of distinctive ichnofauna (trace fossil assemblage). These muddy sediments are typically laminated to massive, may contain pyrite nodules and are often interbedded with thin sandstone units deposited by storm and tide generated currents. The sand-rich sediments of Facies CB5a consist of thinly bedded (typically <20 cm thick), very fine to medium grained, argillaceous sandstone units which are typically trough cross laminated and contain common argillaceous and micaceous drapes. These sediments are interbedded with the muddy lagoon bay sediments described above and are broadly similar to the more distal parts of minor mouthbars (Facies CB4c). In contrast to mouthbar sequences, however, lagoon bay sediments display no well developed vertical sequences. Sands within these sequences are likely to have been reworked by storms and tides from marginal lagoon/bay shoreface and mouthbar sequences.', 'Passage_id': 716}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id A3.2.6 Coastal Marsh Deposits (CB6) Coastal marsh deposits consist of coals and highly carbonaceous mudstones which show evidence of in situ peat development including well developed penetrative root systems. Such sequences are distinguished as coastal marsh rather than peatswamp deposits by their association with lagoonal and shoreface sediments and, locally, by the presence of microplankton within the interbedded mudstones. These intervals have variable but typically high gamma ray values although the response is controlled by the proportion of coals within the interval. More thickly developed coals give characteristic low density response. A3.3 NEARSHORE SILICICLASTIC SEDIMENTS (DA) A3.3.1 Flood Tidal Delta Sediments (DA1) Flood tidal deltas form at the landward end of major tidal inlets and represent bodies of sediment introduced into lagoons and bays by flood tidal currents and to lesser extent by storm generated currents and surges through the tidal inlet (McCubbin, 1982; Boersma, 1988; Murakoshi and Masuda, 1991). Their recognition often relies on an association with tidal inlet, coastal marsh and lagoon/bay sediments. Facies DA1 is typically sand dominated and consists primarily of current rippled and cross bedded, very fine to medium grained sandstones with common mud drapes. Individual sandstone beds are typically thin (~30 cm) but form significantly thicker compound units which typically show well developed vertical profiles of upwards coarsening developed in response to delta migration. A3.3.2 Backshore Complex Sediments (DA2) Sediments of this facies develop in association with barrier systems, of which they form an integral part, and have been subdivided into washover sediments (Facies DA2a) and aeolian sediments (Facies DA2b). Washover sediments include sands and, to lesser extent, silts and muds, which have been reworked from the barrier system and transported into the lagoon or bay behind the barrier. This facies is consequently associated with lagoon/bay sediments and flood tidal deltas but is distinguished from the latter by relative lack of muddy drapes and lack of overall organisation into vertical sequences. The sandstones are typically current rippled to planar laminated and may contain root traces and soft sediment deformation features. In the topographically higher parts of the barrier system, above the water table, sands may be reworked by aeolian processes. These aeolian sequences have low preservation potential but when recognised have been assigned to Facies DA2b. Preserved aeolian sandstones tend to be very thin with only the basal parts of original bedforms preserved. Very well sorted sandstone and the development of bimodal lamination, often in association with high depositional dip angles, can help in the identification of this facies. A3.3.3 Tidal Inlet Sediments (DA3) Tidal inlets are relatively short reach channels which cut barrier systems and link open marine shoreface environments with more protected back barrier, lagoon and restricted bay systems. These channels are broadly comparable to the tidal channels (Facies CB1a) described above and are represented by blocky to fining upwards sandstone sequences (generally 1m-7m thick) with well developed basal scours. The sandstones are typically cross bedded to locally planar laminated with locally developed muddy and/or micaceous drapes representing rapid changes in current energy in response to different stages of the tidal cycle. Tidal inlets rework sediment from the shoreface and the fill of such channels is consequently controlled by the grade of the available sediment. As consequence, they generally lack the coarser grained sediment and carbonaceous/woody debris of', 'Passage_id': 717}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: distributary channels (and to lesser extent tidal channels) which tend to introduce new sediment to the shoreface. Tidal inlets are common in barred delta coastlines (McCubbin, 1982) and where lateral migration is pronounced they may be the most commonly preserved element of the upper shoreface environment (Elliot, 1986). In the present study, both active tidal inlet sediments (Facies DA3a) and abandoned tidal inlet sediments (Facies DA3b) are recognised. The abandoned tidal inlets of Facies DA3b represent incompletely filled tidal inlets which become isolated from their source of sediment supply and are consequently filled by finer grained, lower energy sediments. A3.3.4 Major Mouthbar/Ebb Tidal Delta Sediments (DA4) Ebb tidal deltas are constructional features developed on the seaward side of barrier system and fed by tidal inlets. In the strictest definition, they build seaward in response to ebb tidal flow from restricted lagoons and bays. The features of ebb tidal deltas are, however, broadly comparable to major mouthbars, which are formed where distributary channels or tidal channels debouch into bodies of standing water. Relatively thin, minor mouthbars (Facies CB4c) develop where these channels debouch into restricted lagoons and bays, but where they build into open marine waters the consequent mouthbars may be significantly larger and form thicker sequences. These mouthbars are characterised by coarsening and thickening upwards vertical profiles, the upper parts of which contain fine to coarse grained, current rippled and cross bedded sandstones. Rapid deposition of individual units is commonly reflected in the style of sedimentation and shallowing upwards trends may also be recognised by vertical changes in grain size, sedimentary structures and ichnofauna. As the recognition of ebb tidal deltas sensu stricto relies on association with other facies and the presence of barred shoreline, their unequivocal recognition is often not possible. As consequence, ebb tidal deltas and major mouthbars are assigned to single facies. Proximal (Facies DA4a) and distal (Facies DA4b) parts of these sequences are, however, commonly recognised. A3.3.5 Upper Shoreface Sediments (DA5) Upper shoreface sediments represent the most proximal parts of fully marine environments developed at or immediately seaward of the shoreline. These sediments generally consist of fine to coarse grained, well sorted, clean sandstones. wide variety of bedding styles and sedimentary structures define number of subfacies which indicate the complexity of this nearshore environment:  Foreshore Sediments (DA5a)  Beachface Sediments (DA5b)  Rip Channel Sediments (DA5c)  Longshore/Nearshore Bar Sediments (DA5d)  Longshore/Nearshore Trough Sediments (DA5e) Foreshore sediments of Facies DA5a consist of fine to medium grained sandstones with well developed planar, horizontal lamination and may contain heavy mineral concentrations. Such units develop in very shallow water by repeated wave reworking including swash and backwash processes on the foreshore (Harms et al., 1982). In slightly more offshore locations, the horizontal lamination of the foreshore is gradually replaced by more steeply dipping planar lamination, with common very low angle truncation surfaces developed on the beachface (Facies DA5b). Differentiation of foreshore and beachface sediments is often difficult except in highly deviated wells. Rip channels (Facies DA5c) are erosive features filled by cross bedded sands which cut through the foreshore and beachface. These channels are typically shallow features (often <1m) which are offshore directed and rework the shoreface sediments into offshore locations (Ingle, 1966; Hunter et al., 1979). Facies DA5d represents low angle shoreface-attached barforms represented by relatively high energy wave reworked sediments. These bars as preserved as thin coarsening upwards sequences which are 1-2m', 'Passage_id': 718}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: thick and are formed by tidal or longshore currents running broadly parallel or oblique to the shoreface (Greenwood and Mittler, 1985). Sheltered areas of the shoreface between such bars are represented by lower energy and finer grained shoreface sediments and are assigned to Facies DA5e. A3.3.6 Lower to Middle Shoreface Sediments (DA6) The high energy upper shoreface sediments described above pass gradationally in an offshore direction into the middle and lower shoreface which is dominated by clean to variably argillaceous, very fine to fine grained sandstones. These sequences are developed in relatively shallow water and a number of subfacies are recognised:  Wave Dominated Lower to Middle Shoreface Sediments (DA6a)  Storm Dominated Lower to Middle Shoreface Sediments (DA6b)  Mixed Storm and Wave Influenced Lower to Middle Shoreface Sediments (DA6c) Wave dominated lower shoreface sediments of Facies DA6a contain wave ripple cross lamination and low angle planar cross lamination with common low angle truncations. They typically form coarsening and cleaning upwards sequences which were deposited largely above fair weather wave base with wave swash action forming the low angle dipping surfaces. These sequences locally grade into, and are interbedded with, similar sediments in which wave generated structures are less common and are replaced by unidirectional and oscillatory features including current ripples, swaley to hummocky cross bedding and single event beds. These sequences represent storm dominated lower to middle shoreface sediments (Facies DA6b) which are likely to be preferentially developed in slightly deeper water (largely below fair weather wave base), where storm generated features have a higher preservation potential. It is relatively common to find coarsening upwards, lower to middle shoreface sequences which contain an intimate mix of storm and wave generated features; these sediments are assigned to mixed storm and wave influenced origin (Facies DA6c). The coarsening upwards which is characteristic of these sequences is response to shoreface progradation and represents progressive shallowing of the depositional site. A3.3.7 Offshore Transition Zone Sediments (DA7) The most distal parts of the shoreface pass gradationally offshore into fine grained shelfal sediments. This gradational zone between the lower shoreface and the shelf is known as the offshore transition zone and consists of variably silty and sandy mudstones and argillaceous, very fine grained sandstones which grade upwards into lower shoreface sediments. These argillaceous sediments are typically well bioturbated, with highly diverse ichnofauna, and may contain thin storm generated sandstones representing sediment reworked from an adjacent (coeval) shoreface. A3.3.8 Transgressive Lag Sediments (DA8) Transgressive lag deposits form as result of repeated winnowing and reworking of sediment in response to transgressive event. The interpretation of coarse grained marine units as transgressive in origin is often dependant in part on their stratigraphic location. In terms of sediment character, intervals of Facies DA8 typically consist of thin units of coarse to very coarse, poorly sorted and locally pebbly sandstone which have sharp to erosive contacts with underlying strata. These units may also contain reworked clasts of underlying strata, woody debris and shell fragments and clearly represent high energy marine sediments.', 'Passage_id': 719}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A3.4 SILICICLASTIC MARINE SHELF AND PLATFORM SEDIMENTS (EA) A3.4.1 Subtidal Channel/Shoal Sediments (EA1) Facies EA1 consists of fine to coarse grained sandstones deposited by relatively high energy currents in subtidal setting, generally below wave base. Two subfacies are recognised:  Subtidal Channel Sediments (EA1a)  Subtidal Shoal Sediments (EA1b) Subtidal channels represent laterally confined units with sharp erosive bases which occur in subtidal environment often dominated by lower energy shelfal sediments. The channels are typically filled by fine to coarse grained, cross bedded sandstones with locally common granules and small pebbles. The preserved sediment character often indicates only limited reworking and rapid deposition of individual units, with repeated scour common in lower parts. The subtidal setting of these units is commonly supported by the presence of Cruziana ichnofacies (Frey and Pemberton, 1984) and by lack of wave reworked structures. These features are interpreted as subtidal channels, locally associated with deep tidal scour, with sediment entrainment dominated by tidally generated currents. Subtidal shoals (Facies EA1b) contain similar facies to the subtidal channels described above and were deposited largely below wave base in subtidal, shelfal setting. In contrast to the channels, however, subtidal shoals show lesser degree of scour and are more likely to have coarsening upwards profile with cross laminated to planar laminated lower parts and massive to cross bedded upper parts. These sequences represent minor shoals or barforms developed by tidally generated currents in shelfal setting. A3.4.2 Tidal Sandridge/Sandwave Sediments (EA2) Tidal sandridges and sandwaves bear general similarity to the tidal shoal sediments described above and represent subtidal sandbodies generated by high energy tidal currents in shelfal environment. These units are often more thickly developed than the tidal shoals and may contain relatively large scale avalanche foresets and common micaceous and argillaceous drapes, the latter suggesting consistently variable current regimes. The local presence of very thick foreset laminae (locally in excess of 3cm thick) with moderate to high depositional dips (15-20) suggests the presence of large avalanching slipfaces (Buck, 1985; Surlyk and Noe-Nygaard, 1991). Intervals of Facies EA2 commonly display coarsening and cleaning upwards profile, with concentrations of granules and small pebbles in uppermost parts. This sequence reflects sandridge/sandwave migration with overpassing and/or winnowing occurring on the bar tops. Thickly bedded and thinly bedded variants of this facies may locally be recognised. A3.4.3 Storm Sandridge/Sandwave Sediments (EA3) Storm sandridges/sandwaves are relatively large, low amplitude barforms developed in shelfal settings in response to storm generated currents. They are typically constructed of stacked event beds which are sharp based, normally graded units with horizontal lamination, current ripples and climbing ripple cross lamination formed by rapid deposition from sediment laden flows. Barform migration results in the development of coarsening and cleaning upwards sequences with an associated increase in bedform size. In water depths above storm wave base, relatively large scale hummocky and swaley cross stratification may be formed as result of oscillatory currents. Two subfacies are recognised:', 'Passage_id': 720}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH:  Sandridge/Sandwave Crest Sediments (EA3a)  Sandridge/Sandwave Flank Sediments (EA3b) Facies EA3a represents the coarser and cleaner crestal parts of these sequences, whereas Facies EA3b represents the finer grained and muddier parts of these sequences developed at the margins of the barform. Crestal parts of this sequence may contain common Skolithos and Planolites traces, with more diverse shelfal ichnofauna developed on the flanks of these structures. A3.4.4 Shelfal Sediments (EA4) Sand dominated shelfal sediments which do not form part of discrete genetic sequence, larger bedform or intensely bioturbated intervals are ascribed to Facies EA4. This facies represents areas which were well supplied with sediment reworked from shallow marine environments by storm and/or tidal currents. Three subfacies are recognised within this grouping:  Wave Dominated Shelfal Sediments (EA4a)  Storm Dominated Shelfal Sediments (EA4b)  Mixed Storm and Wave Influenced Shelfal Sediments (EA4c) Wave dominated shelfal sediments of Facies EA4a include shelfal sandstones which show abundant evidence of wave generated structures, including wave ripple cross lamination and form sets. These sequences were deposited in relatively shallow water shelfal settings, largely above fair weather wave base. Storm dominated shelfal sediments of Facies EA4b are formed in deeper or more protected shelfal areas and show structures formed by current and storm wave processes. The sandstones typically occur as discrete event beds which are relatively thinly bedded and contain planar, horizontal and current ripple lamination with local climbing sets and minor hummocky cross stratification. The mixed storm and wave influenced sediments of Facies EA4c show combination of the features described above. All of these shelfal sediments may contain low to moderately intense bioturbation with relatively high diversity, typically as Cruziana ichnofacies. A3.4.5 Bioturbated Shelfal Sediments (EA5) In areas of the shelf with relatively low rates of sedimentation, bioturbation of the substrate is often intense and results in the partial to complete homogenisation of the sediment. In these cases the original depositional processes cannot be confidently interpreted as most, if not all, primary sedimentary structures are destroyed by the biogenic activity. The preservation of trace fossils is, however, often good and these can be useful in identifying the depositional setting. Bioturbated sediments ascribed to Facies EA5 contain relatively diverse ichnofauna which indicates formation in non-restricted, open marine environment and the sediments are best interpreted as shelfal in origin. Typical trace fossils within this facies grouping include Anconichnus, Skolithos, Diplocraterion, Teichichnus, Rhizocorallium, Terebellina, Planolites and variety of less common traces. Different associations of traces and the relative abundance and tiering (or ordering) of these traces can be valuable aids in determining both the depositional setting and in identifying potential stratal surfaces. Two subfacies have been recognised within this grouping:  Sand Dominated Bioturbated Shelfal Sediments (EA5a)  Mud Dominated Bioturbated Shelfal Sediments (EA5b) The sandstones of Facies EA5a are typically fine to very fine grained, poorly sorted and very argillaceous. More rarely, fine to medium and locally coarse grained sandstones with moderately', 'Passage_id': 721}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: BP Norge AS Report No. 8509/Id high to low argillaceous content have been recognised within this facies. Cleaner sandstones typically have more poorly preserved trace fossil assemblage resulting from lack of lithological contrast within the sediment. The mud dominated sediments of Facies EA5b are broadly similar to those of Facies EA5a and typically have high sand content and are very poorly sorted. Individual traces often show their best preservation within this facies, although lack of lithological contrast can hinder recognition of traces in those sediments with particularly low sand content. Facies EA5 is differentiated from the broadly similar bioturbated sediments of Facies DA7 by generally higher degree of bioturbation and the lack of any clearly associated shoreface sediments. A3.4.6 Marine Erosion Lag Deposits (EA6) Major storms and/or periods of reduced sediment supply on the shelf can result in winnowing of the substrate and the development of relatively coarse grained units. These sediments are typically thinly developed and often include concentration of the coarser grained elements of the shelfal sediment including shell fragments, quartzose granules and reworked early diagenetic nodules. Longer periods of erosion and winnowing may allow the development of firmgrounds which are locally recognised on the basis of trace fossil assemblages including the Glossifungites ichnofacies (Frey and Seilacher, 1980) which commonly includes Thalassinoides burrows. Early diagenetic cements and concentrations of ooids and chamositic grains may also be associated with this facies, although extensive periods of non deposition result in true condensed sequences and are assigned to Facies EA7. A3.4.7 Condensed Sediments (EA7) Long periods of reduced sedimentation on the shelf result in the development of condensed sediments. Such conditions can be caused by variety of factors including rise in relative sea level and autocyclic reductions in sediment supply or changes in the pathways of sediment supply. Two subfacies are recognised within this group:  Condensed Mudstones Sediments (EA7a)  Condensed Limestones/Ironstones (EA7b) Condensed mudstones of Facies EA7a consist of relatively sand-poor mudstones which are locally laminated and are typically dark grey in colour. These mudstones may be associated with early diagenetic siderite cementation and may locally contain concentrations of chamositic ooids and pellets. Ironstones represent periods of prolonged sediment starvation at the depositional site resulting in extensive siderite cementation and the development of associated ferruginous cements.', 'Passage_id': 722}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Well 6507/5-4, Sedimentology, Petrography and Reservoir Geology APPENDIX Petrographic Techniques Standard Thin-section Petrography Standard petrographical techniques have been used throughout the study. Mineral determinations have been made using Nikon Optiphot-pol polarising microscope. Thin-sections have been impregnated with blue-dyed resin, and stained for carbonates with combined alizarin red-S and potassium ferricyanide and for K-feldspar with sodium cobaltinitrate. Scanning Electron Microscopy Analysis by scanning electron microscopy was undertaken on an in-house Jeol JSM-35CF microscope with PGT System EDS attachment. Secondary electron imaging was undertaken on pieces of core which had been cleaned and gold coated prior to analysis. Back-scattered electron imaging was undertaken on carbon coated, polished thin-sections. X-ray Diffraction Analysis The whole-rock and clay-fraction sample preparation, analysis and interpretation was conducted by X-ray Mineral Services, Betws-y-Coed, North Wales. Preliminary Sample Preparation The core plug remnants were treated in the following manner before XRD analysis:  the samples were initially cleaned, where necessary, using distilled water to remove superficial contaminants on the core plug surface;  if the samples were contaminated with oil, they were further cleaned using toluene;  the samples were gently crushed until fragments (<5mm in diameter) were obtained. Whole-rock Preparation The sample is gently disaggregated using mortar and pestle, and approximately 2g of material is then placed into McCrone micronizing mill for minutes. The slurry is then dried, and the resulting powder is tightly packed and reverse mounted into an aluminium sample holder.', 'Passage_id': 723}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6507/5-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Whole-rock Analysis Instrument Conditions A Hiltonbrooks generator with Philips PW1050 goniometer is used to carry out all XRD measurements. The whole-rock powders are run from 5-6029 with step size of 0.05, and are exposed to X-ray radiation from copper anode at 40kV 30mA. Clay-fraction Preparation (<2m) Clay-fraction preparation was conducted in the following manner:  The samples are crushed gently in pestle and mortar until the material is homogeneous, and appears to be totally disaggregated.  5g of the sample is mixed with 50 ml of distilled water and ml of Calgon (sodium hexametaphosphate and sodium carbonate solution).  The samples are then placed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes, stirred, and then transferred to mixing table, where they are then agitated at speed of 250 rpm for hours. After stirring they are again placed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes.  The clay suspension is then centrifuged at speed of 1000 rpm for minutes, and supernatant liquid decanted into beaker. The centrifuge process is repeated twice in order to obtain 200 ml of supernatant.  The total weight of clay extracted is obtained by removing 20 ml of the clay suspension, and evaporating this to dryness. To extract size fractions other than <2 m, the centrifuge speed and time are varied accordingly (e.g. for <5 m size fraction, centrifuge speed of 300 rpm for minutes is used).  clay mount is then made using the Millipore filter (filtering the clay suspension until an even clay layer is achieved). rectangle is cut out of the dried filter, and mounted into the aluminium XRD slide. Clay-fraction Analysis Analysis of the clay-fraction mount was carried out under four conditions:  Analysis of sample after air-drying.  Analysis of air dried sample which is supersaturated in ethylene glycol overnight, using temperature of 65C.  Analysis of glycolated samples heated for two hours at 380C.  Analysis of 380C heated samples further heated at 550C for hour. Clay-fraction Analysis Instrument Conditions measurements. The clay-fraction samples are run from 3-3229 with step size of 0.05, and are exposed to X-ray radiation from copper anode at 40 kV 30mA.

Moderately well sorted, but intensely bioturbated with Teichichnus, Anconichnus, Terebellina, Palaeophycus, Zoophycus, Siphonichnus, Planolites and Thalassinoides. Chondrites and Asterosoma also occur locally in the top mudstone unit. This upper unit is also locally very pyritic and variably glauconitic, with chamositic ooids and ?phosphatic intraclasts. Upper mudstone unit is overlain by thin unit of: SANDY ?DOLOMITIC MUDSTONE: light fining/?deepening upwards sequence, which is dominated by argillaceous, micaceous and locally pyritic sands and thinner, subordinate muds. Both lithologies are heavily bioturbated by high diversity assemblage of trace fossils which, together with the consistent grain size over much of the interval, suggests relatively low energy levels in stable and generally constant outer shelf, open marine environment. The upper part of this zone shows gradual change to shallowing upward trend, with slightly increasing and more fluctuating grain size profile and intermittent intervals of storm dominated sandy shelf sediments. However, the uppermost part (Reservoir subzone 7.9) consists of sandy dolomitic, sideritic, glauconitic mudstones which are strongly pyritic and contain chamositic ooids.

Mean Phi = 16.50% Mean Kha = 4.80mD Stdev Kha = Count 17 JS3 JS3.7 Reservoir zones JS1 to JS3 are uncored in this well but their lithologies are tentatively described based on an interpretation of their wireline log responses and comparisons with similar cored intervals in well 6507/5-1. Zone JS3 is dominated by relatively thick (c. 10m) possibly slightly argillaceous interval of blocky, slightly coarsening/ cleaning upwards sands. These show slight decreasing upward gamma ray profile, and slightly more positive neutron/density crossover upwards, also. This sand is separated from similar sands above by thin (1.5m) but possibly areally extensive mudstone/argillaceous siltstone. It is separated from 2m sand unit at the base of this zone by 3m of heterolithics, which have higher gamma values and negative neutron/density crossover. Zones JS1 to JS3 are uncored in this well. Interpretations of depositional environments for these zones are therefore based on their log responses in this well and comparisons with similar zones in well 6507/5-1. where these stratigraphic intervals are cored. Zone shows similar log responses to the comparable interval in well 6507/5-1, although it is possibly slightly finer grained or more argillaceous in its lower parts. This zone may therefore have been deposited in similar, slightly restricted to restricted marine shoreface to lagoon/bay shoreface settings. JS3. ^ JS3.5 JS3.5 JS3.3 JS2 JS2.9 This zone shows an overall coarsening upwards profile, but is very heterolithic in detail. The base of the interval consists of thin, but possibly quite clean sandstone about 1m thick, with relatively low gamma log values and slight positve neutron density crossover. This is overlain by relatively thick (8.5m) interval of mudstones and heterolithics with high gamma ray values and strongly negative neutron/density crossover. This is, in turn, overlain by thick (12m) interval of heterolithics, which show an overall slight coarsening up profile. They have rapidly fluctuating gamma ray response and fluctuating but predominantly negative neutron/density crossover. The top of this zone consists of about 3m of muds with high gamma values and strongly negative neutron/density crossover. Zone JS2 shows similar, typical heterolithic log responses to those of the equivalent zone in well 6507/5-1, and may therefore have been deposited in similar depositional environments. However, in this well the basal sands of subzones and found in well 6507/5-1 are much reduced in thickness, being represented by only 1m of sand at the base of the zone. This may indicate relatively distal position for this well compared to well 6507/5-1 at this time. The mudstones and thinly interbedded heterolithics above this basal sand were probably deposited in fully marine to restricted marine embayments and weakly progradational, fine grained shoreface or inner shelf environments, respectively. .7 JS2.7 JS1.8 JS2.1/2.3 JS2.5 2.3 JS .1/ ARE JS1 Zone is incompletely covered by wireline logs, but where logs exist their responses suggest that the interval is dominated by three sequences of thinly bedded heterolithics. Each sequence is about 10-14m thick and appears to show an overall coarsening upwards trend, with decreasing gamma log responses and upward decreasing negative to slightly positive neutron/density crossovers. The uppermost sequence is generally predicted to be finer grained than the lower two sequences, with significantly higher gamma values and more strongly negative neutron/density crossover. Zone JS1 comprises the uppermost part of the Are Formation. The available log responses and comparison with the same interval in well 6507/5-1 suggests that this zone probably consists of heterolithic units deposited in marginal marine lagoonal and estuarine settings. The individual coarsening upwards units may represent prograding distal to middle delta or lower shoreface sands.

The Melke Formation unit has weakly developed progradational profile capped by minor flooding event. This unit may represent distal correlative of northerly-derived sands recognised in the Norne area and the 'Upper' Garn Formation sands in more marginal areas of the basin. CB Shoreface Marginal DA marine EA Shelfal NOT JS15 Sequence 3d Sequence 3d consists of the Garn and Not Formations, with the base at 3608.7m MD and the top at 3502.0m MD. The base of the sequence is picked on the flooding surface at the base of the Not Formation, which is correlable with the 'base Rannock shale' in the North Viking Graben and the base of the Sortehat Formation in East Greenland. The top of the sequence is picked at the base of the Melke Formation. The base of the Garn Formation is not believed to represent sequence boundary but is better viewed as forced regressive surface. This allocyclic response is thought to be controlled by sediment supply rate and the morphology of the Middle Jurassic seaway. Associated with is possible hinterland rejuvenation.

Regionally, Sequence 3c shows marked thickness variation due to localised structuration. Sequence 3b Sequence 3c ILE I2 ILE JS9.6 JS9.4 JS9.2 JS8.7 JS8.3 40/42 ROR R6 JS7 JS7.9 Sequence 3b comprises most of the Ror Formation with its base at 3677.1m MD (top Ror 2) and its top at 3632.7m MD (top Ror 6). The base of the sequence is poorly defined but regionally throughout Mid-Norway represents sequence boundary. Zones Ror 4, and have the characteristic progradational profiles with the maximum flooding surface at the base of Ror 4. JS7.8 JS7.7 JS7.5 JS7.3 JS7.1 R2 Seq.3a This Sequence 3a comprises Zones Ror and 2. These were deposited during relative sea level rise. The base of the sequence coincides with the base of Megasequence 3. Seq.2c Sequence 2c consists of only Zone Tilje and regionally is topped and based sequence boundaries. This sequence is not seen in well 6507/5-2. TILJE T6 JS6 JS6.8 JS6.4 Sequence 2b The base of Sequence 2b represents regional erosion/unconformity surface marking an abrupt basinward shift in facies and is tentatively correlated with sequence boundary within the Gule Horn Member of the Neill Klinter Formation in East Greenland (Dam and Surlyk, 1995) and the base of the Cook Formation in the North Viking Graben. JS4 JS5 ?56 Sequence 2a The base of Sequence 2a is not encountered in well 6507/5-4. The top of the sequence is defined by regionally extensive erosion surface locally associated with degree of unconformity. This sequence records progressive increase in marine influence punctuated by discrete flooding surfaces with overlying progradational packages. Significantly, this interpretation suggests that the base of the Tilje Formation is conformable to only slightly discordant and no significant change in depositional setting occurs between the top of the Are Formation into the overlying Tilje Formation.

The top of the Garn Formation was penetrated at RKB. Most of the Garn Formation shows good reservoir properties, (Figure 3.1.1). The Garn Formation is subdivided into three layers based on reservoir properties, see Table 3.1.1. Between 2 RKB the sandstone contains considerable amount of mica. However, the permeability and porosity measurements performed on the cores from this interval indicate good reservoir properties (Figure 3.1.1 and Table 3.1.1). The reservoir quality of the Garn layer is poorer than for the Garn and layers. The porosities in the Garn 3 layer varies between 15 and 22 %. Most of the permeability values varies between and 10 mD, but there is measured two permeability values above 100 mD over the same interval. This give an average permeability for the Garn layer to mD, (Table 3.1.1). The Not Formation consists mainly of shale. The Ile Formation is subdivided into two layers and the Tofte Formation is subdivided into four layers based on reservoir properties. The sandstones in the Ile and the Tofte Formations have very good reservoir quality. The log porosities vary between and % and the core porosities vary between and %.

The gas-oil contact is interpreted from the FMT pressure plot to be at 2605 RKB. The FMT indicates an oil-water contact at 2714 RKB, Figure 3.2.1. The electric logs indicate an oil-water contact at RKB. The oil-water contact is interpreted to RKB (Figure 3.1.1). 3.1.1 Log Analysis The general log qualities from the Atlas wireline logs were good. The dual laterolog was depth shifted up in 'the interval 8 RKB, compared to the GR- log. Spectralog was also shifted up 0.15m in the interval 8 RKB. The compensated neutron log was shifted down in the interval 2560 RKB - TD. A shaly sand model has been applied for the log evaluation. The shale parameters used are based on crossplots and visual inspection of the logs. The porosity is calculated from limestone/sandstone model.

At approximately 2030 RBK the pore pressure gradient seems to have reach the maximum value which is estimated to g/cm3. The pressure gradient then starts to decrease. At top of the Melke Formation (2347 RKB) an increase in the pore pressure gradient seems to appear. At approximately 2400 RKB the pressure gradient is estimated to be g/cm3.

One of the critical success factors was the casing point pick for the 5/8 casing. The drilling plan was based on the assumption that the pressure transition in the Lower Cretaceous would develop as predicted; hard transition with pore pressure increasing from sg to sg in  150 metres TVD. The 5/8 casing would be set in the Lower Cretaceous as deep as possible without crossing the Base Cretaceous Unconformity (BCU) into the Jurassic as there was great concern on both the pressure environment in the Jurassic and the lithology just below the BCU. The Leak Off Test and nature of the pressure transition would be key driver in picking the casing point. However, during the drilling, the pressure transition started as predicted but the hard nature of it did not develop as expected and the key formation picks were coming in high to prognosis. As result, the process of picking the casing point was modified to more simplistic method based on palaeontology. Cutting samples were studied for the age of the bugs. Once the age group of bugs that indicated the lower Cromer Knoll were identified, drilling stopped. At this point, pore pressure was estimated to be sg and the MW was 1.57 sg. The 5/8 casing was set and cemented. Upon drilling out, the BCU was penetrated after some 15m MD of 81/2 hole. 8 1/2 Hole The 5/8 shoe track was drilled out with the same Versavert OBM system used for the 12 1/4 hole section, weighted up to sg. Again, an acceptable formation integrity test was obtained that was slightly higher than expected (1.98 sg). Initially, the FIT was taken to sg EMW. Since this was below the expected LOT, the shoe was re-tested to sg. Drilling continued to TD at 4360m MD/3922m TVD. No cores were obtained. The MW was increased three times and TD MW was sg based on resistivity and drilling trends indicating pore pressure increases. The pore pressure monitoring/detection was done in conjunction with Conoco Inc. Reservoir Technology Professional onshore (day shift) and KSI engineer offshore (night shift). This worked extremely well and resulted in very accurate assessment of pore pressure. To support this, the MDT pressure in the Statfjord indicated pore pressure of sg EMW. The MW at TD was sg. During the hole sections, three (3) events occurred resulting in hours of Lost Time. These were as follows: 1 hour to perform 2nd FIT below the 5/8 shoe 2 hours to troubleshoot the Resistivity at the Bit (RAB) Tool 9.5 hours to POOH to the 5/8 shoe and change out leaking Kelly Hose.

All involved in this drilling operation has demonstrated their professionalism in this relation. a) Health and Hygiene There were neither health nor hygiene incidents onboard the rig. The company doctor cooperated closely with Transoceans medical staff. To assist the medical staff onboard Conoco engaged 24-hrs/d duty-doctor service for service to the rig. b) Safety The safety statistics from this operation shows that there were no lost time accidents, but near misses: The near misses in brief: Preventive actions Climbing down fixed ladder in the derrick hammer snagged across member and pulled free from securing line. It fell 30 to rig floor. Special tools for use in derrick installed and permit to work introduced for work in derrick When pulling the grab handle on container the weld failed Inspection improved A sling lifting 700 kg tool parted and tool fell m, due to corroded wire rope. Restriction on slinging, re-inspected all lifting equipment Safety latch for hook modified to close both ways Procedure for specialized loads modified A short wire roped fore runner, unloaded, swung and came off the main hook. Safety latch opened inwards 1 of tools strapped to pallet came loose and fell to main deck. Single strap used to tie tools to pallet Well 34/6-1 was the fourth well drilled back-to-back by the rig. During the three previous wells Conoco had close contact with Transocean on HSE issues. Through this contact Conoco could familiarize itself with Transoceans system for managing the HSE activities. Transocean managed the operations onboard the rig well also within the area of health, safety and environment. It had implemented several safety initiatives (Start, Think, Focus, Synergi, Tofos and Empac), which together have served to keep the rigs crew and the third party service contractors focused on safety.

The Tilje Fm. in the CC4 segment (MDT in 12 1/4section only) was oil filled, and depleted by 40-50 bars. The most likely cause is depletion through the production of the neighboring well 6407/7-A-13 H. The branch point elevation was chosen in Tilje 2B and this position was used as target for BY1HT2 which was sidetracked from 2700m MDRKB above the reservoir in CC1.Well track BY1HT2 was drilled according to the new plan, but the hole was lost due to stuck BHA at 3885 MDRKB and tight hole at 3445 MDRKB. The drilling problems were interpreted to be related to faulting, depletion and the presence of coal. Track BY1HT3 was drilled from 3000 MDRKB in BY1HT2 and lies between the two earlier tracks. The TD of 12 1/4 section was set at 4070 MDRKB in Tilje 2B, close to the originally planned TD for track BY1H. Beyond this depth BY1HT3 was drilled with 1/2 hole size. BY1HT3 (8 1/2) The 1/2 section was drilled first south and then west, skirting around the southern margin of the square horst block that was penetrated by A10 H, and first down in A10AH. This horst has well defined 4d response, and the Tilje Fm was successfully avoided. The horsts southern bounding fault has throw of 60-78 and the well was deliberately planed to enter the re Fm within the horst for short interval to maintain good line in the direction of CC6, and avoid penetration of the Ror Formation in region where the Tilje Fm was largely omitted by faulting. As drilling progressed bedding dip measurements turned from 19 degs to the east, to 14 degs to the south (a normal drag) and the horsts southern bounding fault was encountered obliquely (+115 MD relative to prognosis). An interval of re (dipping degs to the south) was penetrated, before the well emerged again into the Tilje Fm across the horsts western bounding fault (+17m MD relative to prognosis), which had throw of 39 m. The information collected during the drilling of the 12 1/4 section led to an increased focus on the low angle normal fault structural model, and consequently change of well path in the western part of CC4, close to the fault separating CC4 from CC6. The change was done as an increased risk of penetrating the lower part of Ror Fm with an adverse angle was identified. The lower part of the Ror Fm formation has been seen to collapse on some occasions during the previous drilling campaign, especially if the wellbore/bedding intersection angle was <20 degs. Drilling down to avoid the Ror Fm was excluded because of the risk of encountering the OWC. Once the well re-entered the Tilje Fm, after passing through re in the A10 horst, the well was drilled upwards through the entire Tilje Fm and stratigraphy exited the reservoir into the Ror Fm (+42m MD relative to prognosis). Bedding dip in this block increased from to 17 degs westward describing roll-over anticline to the CC4/CC6 bounding fault. Because the well climbed with an inclination of 105 deg, and the bedding dipped in the opposite direction with an apparent dip along the wellbore of 14 degs, the well/bedding intersection angle on exiting the Tilje Fm was 29 degrees, considerably above the 20 deg requirement. After exiting the reservoir the well was turned downwards to make an arch within the Ror Fm, and aimed at new landing point within the Tilje Fm in CC6, which is an up-faulted block to the west of the CC4 graben. The shallow east dipping (c. 30-35 deg) CC6 bounding fault was penetrated close to prognosis (-33 MD), and juxtaposed the Tilje (dipping 19 degs to the south) against the Ror Fm (dipping degs to the SSW). Seismic interpretation shows that the fault has throw of 62 where penetrated, and that the throw increases northward. south dipping intra CC6 fault with throw of 22 was also encountered (+68 MD relative to prognosis). This fault returns Page A-14 of 67', 'Passage_id': 780}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6407/7-A-10 BY1H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: NORSK HYDRO ASA FINAL WELL REPORT the well path to Tilje 2, after long interval in Tilje 3. Within the CC6 block, internal fault blocks showed bedding dip to the south of 16-37 degs. The oil-water contact in CC6 was uncertain prior to drilling, but the existing A-10 AH well showed water in Aare at depth of 2866 TVD MSL in CC6. Resistivity readings at 2840 TVD MSL in A-10 BY1HT3 indicated relative close proximity to water. To the south, in the CC5 segment (penetrated by A-11 H) an OWC was seen at 2854 TVD MSL, and this contact has been adopted for the CC6 segment as well. Lack of MDT measurements in CC6 makes the definition of contact uncertain, and it could be placed deeper than 2854, but not deeper than 2866 m TVD MSL (assuming common OWCs in Tilje and re) The outer part of BY1HT3 was also geo-steered down in the stratigraphy by turning right (northward). This was done to avoid being trapped between the OWC and base Ror Fm in the southerly dipping strata. This geo-steering increased the chances of getting longer reservoir section in CC6 than would have been the case with the originally planned well path. TD was reached at 6115 MD RKB in the Spekk Formation. BY2H The BY2H branch exited from BY1HT3 through previously installed MLT window (at 3968 mMDRKB) within the CC4 graben, between the CC1 and A10 horst bounding faults. It was drilled southward and upward, following Tilje 2B in 7-13 deg NW tilted fault block. Close to TD the well penetrated major, 75 throwing and 35 deg SE dipping, fault (+5 relative to prognosis), and then drilled into the middle parts of the Ror Fm. This fault bounds the Central Area from the East Flank (CC3 in pre-2004 models). Unfortunately c. thick lens of the lower unstable portion of the Ror Fm was encountered within the fault zone, which caved in, causing the pipe to get stuck and the BHA to be lost. No MDT was run, but log interpretation indicates oil in the whole section. From 4246 MDRKB to TD at 4833 MDRKB the well was left as an open hole section. BY3H The BY3H branch exited from BY2H (at 4246 MD) within the NW tilted fault block and was drilled downward and to the south-west to TD at 5108 MDRKB. The well was planned to stop at least 100 short of the fault that collapsed onto the BHA in BY2H (see above). At first the well was drilled in the Tilje zone and then descended to Tilje (where dips of degs were recorded). It was anticipated that that the well should penetrate the western bounding fault of the NW tilted block (prognosed at 4623 MDRKB) and enter new 19 deg SW dipping block. The bounding fault was encountered later than expected (at MDRKB) and had southerly rather than westerly dip. The fault returned the well to Tilje 2B. After the new block was entered, a narrow graben (c. 60 interval, containing bedding dips of 17 deg NW) was encounted prior to entering the main part of the new block. No MDT was run, but the logs indicate oil in the whole section. Formations are given in Table 2.5.1. A pre-perforated liner was run from 3978 to 5108 MD.

No additional corrections have been applied on log data. 2.4 Model / Reservoir zonation A detailed zonation of the Tilje and re Formations is listed in Figure 2.5.1. The Tilje Fm. is divided into reservoir zones, the Aare Fm. is divided into two zones. During drilling of the well the log interpretation to define reservoir zones was guided by real time biostratigrahic interpretation. The definition of zones within the Tilje formation is based on combination of logs, biostrat and correlation with nearby wells.

The reservoar zonation and log derived petrophysical averages for the well tracks are presented in Figure 3.6.2.1  3.6.2.5. The petrophysical input parameters are listed in Figure 3.6.1. Cut-off criterion for net sand is effective porosity (PHIE) > 1% and Vshale < 40%. Net pay cut-off parameters are PHIE > % , Vshale < 40 % and effective water saturation Sw < 70%. The highest porosities are found in zone Tilje 2B in segment CC1 with net sand porosity average is 22-28%. In segment CC4 and CC6 the net sand porosity average of zone Tilje 2B is lower, in the range of 16-22 %. In the re Formation the net sand porosities are typically in the range of 14-22 %. 3.2 Discussion In segment CC1 Tilje was found to be gas and condensate filled with depletion of 125-135 bar. re was undepleted and oil filled. In CC4 Tilje was oil filled and depleted with 40-50 bar (MDT in 12 1/4 section only). Based on log data Tilje is interpreted to be oil filled in CC6. No MDT data was recorded in CC6. The oil-water contacts are not seen in these well tracks, but based on log data it is interpreted that welltrack A-10 BY1HT3 is drilled close to the OWC in the intervals of 5400-5450 , 5705-5765 and 6050  6075 MDRKB. From 5400  6075 MDRKB the wellpath is building from 2840 m  2820 TVDSS. As the wellpath appears to be close to the OWC even though the wellpath has built 20 TVD, could indicate stepwise OWCs with the OWC getting shallower in the toe section. 3.3 CPI input data The curves used for the composite logs are also used as input for the petrophysical analysis. Details on source logs/curves and splicing depths are given in the PetroBank Composite Log Information File and the PetroBank CPI information File. 3.3.1 Log quality The log quality is generally good. The Vision Resistivity Tool (ARC) was run over reservoar sections. This tool provided gamma ray measurements and multi-depth resistivity measurements. AVision Density Neutron Tool (VDN) was run in both real-time and recorded memory modes during the 12 1/4 and 1/2 sections. The VDN tool records Density, Ultrasonic Standoff and Photoelectric Effect (PEF) by 16 sectors, each measurement being referenced to the top of the hole. This sector data allows the presentation of Density, PEF and Ultrasonic Standoff images. Density measurements are not environmentally corrected, but are borehole compensated. The VDN tool also records thermal neutron porosity (TNPH) which is calculated using limestone matrix and is corrected for environmental effects. The TNPH, unlike the density measurement, is not an azimuthal measurement, as the neutron source is not focused.

As the Tilje Fm was not re-entered as prognosed, it was decided to build the inclination to locate the Tilje reservoir. This was achieved, and the well TD was set at 4207m with an inclination of 132.80. The well was plugged back to 2640m MD RKB. Two MDT logging run were carried out. Two pressure points were recorded the first run, and 30 pressure test were recorded the second run. The MDT tool was run TLC conveyed. A-10 BY1HT2 The well TD is 4075 MDRKB. At 3822m the BHA became differentially stuck and no memory data was retrieved from this section. The hole was cemented back and sidetracked. A-10 BY1HT3 No VDN (density/neutron) was run in this section, to keep the BHA as slick as possible to reduce risk of getting differentally stuck. The well TD was set at 6115m MD. At 4833m MD RKB the BHA became stuck in hole. No memory data was retrieved from this section. Good real time and memory data, except for angle unreliable on VDN images real time. TD of the well was set at 5108 MD RKB MD. 3.3.2 Corrections For information on environmental corrections, please see the Petrobank info file from the service company. No additional corrections have been applied on log data. 3.4 Evaluation Method The petrophysical evaluation is based on data from individual MWD/LWD bit runs, all logged by Schlumberger. The computed interpretation has been generated in Recall, using the PETROS module, with the applications SANDS (CPI) and SUM (average petrophysical results). Vertical depths have been calculated from the survey data through application of the enhanced minimum curvature method. Shale volume was calculated from the apparent matrix/grain density method (Konen  Bateman) by the use of density and neutron logs. This Vshale approach reduces the two dimensional density  neutron crossplot analysis to single apparent grain density curve RHGA that can be interpreted in similar fashion to Vsh from gamma ray: Vshale from RHGA : VRHGA = RHGA  min RHGA maxRHGA  minRHGA Page A-43 of 67', 'Passage_id': 786}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6407/7-A-10 BY1H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: In 12.25 hole section in well 6407/7-A-10 BY1HT3, from 3050  4067 MD RKB, Vsh was calculated from the linear gamma ray method, as no density and neutron logs were aquired in this interval. The total porosity was calculated from the density log using the relationship:  = ma - b , ma - fl  - The total porosity (fraction) ma - Matrix density (g/cc) b - Bulk density curve (g/cc) fl - Apparent fluid density (g/cc) The effective porosity was calculated from the total porosity and shale volume via the equation:  =    e Vsh ma sh ma fl !e - Effective Porosity (fraction) !t - Total Porosity (fraction) sh - Shale density (g/cc) fl - Apparent fluid density (g/cc) Vsh - Shale volume (fraction) Hydrocarbon correction in the gas and oil zones was applied for porosity calculations. Oil based mud was used and as no microresistivity log was available, density log hydrocarbon correction was performed with the approximation that Sxo=Sw. Hydrocarbon density parameters are listed in Figure 3.6.1. Petrophysical Input Parameters. To evaluate movable hydrocarbons the effective water saturation, Swe, was calculated from the Indonesia Equation. Shale resistivity and density are based on visual inspection of logs. Matrix density is taken from core measurements of correlative sections in neighboring wells. Formation water resistivity stems from analysis of DST bottomhole sample in Well 6407/7-4. Temperature reference for the Njord Field is 123.4 C at 3300 TVD MSL and gradient C/m. For further details, please se the PetroBank info file; WL_PETRO_COMPUTE_OUTPUT_INF.PDF for these welltracks.

The MDT tool was also run on TLC Wireline in the A-10 BY1HT3 1/2 section, but the tool failed and no further attempt was done due to the possibility of hole stability problems. 3.5.2 Fluid Contacts The Oil - Water Contact in CC6 was uncertain prior to drilling, but the former well A-10 AH showed water in re at depth of 2866 TVD MSL in CC6. Resistivity readings at 2840 TVD MSL indicate proximity to water, and based on the OWC seen in the CC5 segment penetrated by well A- 11 H, contact of 2854 TVD MSL was chosen for the CC6 segment. Lack of MDT in CC6 makes the definition of contact uncertain, and it could be placed deeper than 2854, but not deeper than 2866 TVD MSL. 3.5.3 Depletion The description below refers to Figure 3.6.4. Formation pressure, gradients and fluids, but also to general considerations by comparison to nearby wells. Lower pressures than the initial 380 bar were recorded in the CC1 and CC4 segments: A-10 BY1H: Tilje Formation, CC1 Segment - Gas/Condensate filled. Tilje 2-4 is depleted with 125 bar, and gas filled. Tilje shows 10 bar lower pressure than Tilje 2-4, and is filled with condensate. re Formation, CC1 Segment - Oil. MDT pressures were recorded, indicating oil and undepleted formation. Triassic Group, CC1 Segment  Water Filled Water filled Triassic Group is interpreted from the LWD logs. Tilje Formation, CC4 Segment - Oil filled. The Tilje formation in the CC4 segment (MDT in 12 1/4 section only) was oil filled, and depleted by 40-50 bar. The most likely cause is depletion through the production of the neighbouring A-13 well. Tilje 1-2 shows 10 bar lower pressure than Tilje 3-4.

The well was planned to be opened to 13 1/2 on the next run. Drilled next stand without any problems, and continued to drill to TD @ 4078 m. From 4078 it was decided to backreame above 3850 to control the hole, before pumping slug. On the connection before the problem zone it was observed extra torque, when rota- tion started. After that observation it was decided to ream the next stand very gentle and thorough. The next single was slided down before connection and when the slips came off, it was impossible to rotate the string. The string was stuck with bit on 3885 (4 febr. 2003). We were able to circulate and therefore most probably differ- ential stuck. The BHA also included 8 DC, which was not according to the drilling program. Attempted to jar free. Pumped 10m3 diesel pill around the BHA and dis- placed the marine riser to seawater before attempted to jar free with max. 295 tons overpull. Rigged up wire line for DP cutter. The problem: The bit stands between two coal layers that marks the transition-zone between Tilje 1 and Tilje 2. No scouring from the coal layer was seen during further drilling. Had problems with sliding in after connections from 3870 m. No indications on depacking while drilling or after the stuck situation. This indicates differential stuck. Pressure conditions: MDT measurement in track shows 0.90-0.96 g/cc equivalent mud weight (EMW) in the Tilje fault segment, in what corresponds to depletion of about 120 bar. With statick overbalance (mudweight 1,55) is it 155-160 bar. On the other side of the fault segment, Tilje was measured to 1,22 g/cc (EMW) that corresponds static over- balance on maximum 93 bar. The depletion is about 50 bar. In the re formation the EMW was measured to 1.38-1.42 g/cc, and that corre- sponds static overbalance on 35 bar. Evaluation of overbalance /differential sticking causes: The pressure conditions can technical speaking be transferred from track to track 2, with negligible adjustments for gradients and true vertical depth (TVD). Under the condition that we have the same pressure conditions as in track the static over- balance will be 91 bar, over the bottom hole assembly (BHA). That is what most ge- ologists consider as most likely. Compared to the overbalance in segment C1, its difficult to understand that there was no differential sticking even in the Tilje formation with 160 bar overbalance. More work are needed on the static basis concern to gas ratio logs and pressure on Njord, so they can be used with more certainty. Some experience from Snorre: On Snorre it has been several incidents of loss of 12 1/4  BHA caused by differen- tial sticking, despite that the BHA are optimised to avoid this. On 34/7-A-AHT two bottom hole assemblies (BHA) was lost caused by differential sticking. Both times this happened it was during wiper trip after the hole had been drilled. major cause to the problem was that the casing depth for the 5/8, was set to close to the depleted reservoir. After loss of the first BHA rotation and sliding in all operation was in big interest. Despite this the BHA was lost shortly after the sidetrack. Over- balance was never measured but can be estimated to 100 bar. Its worth noticing that in the 1/2 section with the same mud weight went without any problems.', 'Passage_id': 793}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6407/7-A-10 BY1H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: B-12 Shut of and plug back.

Experience: Primarily it is important to gain knowledge from Snorre concerning cause and action that must be done to avoid differential stuck problems. Despite that the MDT showed significant depletion, it was no focus to make up bottom hole assembly that could have avoided differential sticking.

No progress. Increased to 46 ton overpull, and the string came free. Pulled out with the whipstock. Spear was about m from no-go in the bottom of the whipstock. Conclusion from Halliburtons FWR: The whipstock was retrieved with spear assembly after the HRT retrieval failed. During visual inspection of the whipstock once it was retrieved, it was obvious that the bore inside the whipstock had been decreased due to excessive wear. The edges along the throat of bore were sharpened and had collapsed inwards, creating a restriction that possibly prevented the HRT tool from entering the bore on the first retrieval attempt, and could explain the overpull that was observed as the HRT was pulled out of the restricted bore after engagement. The extreme tight bore could also make it more plausible that the retrieving spear en- tered the lateral branch during the first attempt to sting into the whipstock. slight miss-alignment of the spear would have caused it to ride over the whipface and into open hole. Markings on the fish-neck (6.53 OD) of the spear could potentially have been made as it entered the drop liner PBR and stood-up on the HR-sleeve (ID of 6.29) when the drop liner had been pushed to bottom. An overpull of 16 tons was observed, and could possibly be related to pulling the x-over free from the PBR.', 'Passage_id': 802}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/6-C-6 CT2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Experience Detail No.: Keywords: Wellname: Installation/Ri g: Country: Stop time: SIDETRACKING,CASING MILLING 30/6-C-6 OSEBERG NORWAY 2002-05-13 20:30:00 Category: PO: Phase: Operator: Field: RECOMMEND NORSK HYDRO Description: It has been usual practice on Oseberg C(and other installations) to use bridge plug as fundament for setting the 13 3/8 whipstock when sidetracking well. In an effort to simplify the operation with the 18 5/8 whipstock the top of the 13 3/8 casing (after being cut) was used as the fundament. As long as mechanical or cement plug is not required as barrier the only function of the fundament is to take enough weight to trigger the anchor plunger. The bottom of the whipstock is 13 3/8 plate which was considered sufficient to set against the 13 3/8 casing stub without modification. The whipstock was set in accordance to Red baron procedure without problem. Recommendation: If there is no requirement for barrier the top of cut casing should be sufficient to act as fundament for setting of whipstock (may need to check for smaller dimensions). This saves costs and risks associated with running of mechanical plug or setting cement. In addition there can be considerable lead time in ordering bridge plug of this size.

Due to limited cuttings and mud handling capacity on Oseberg it was decided to drill the 16 section (approx. 2000m) in two stages, firstly 12 1/4 pilot then 16 hole opening run (1 run planned with PDC cutters). The 12 1/4 section was drilled without problems and the drillbit showed little wear despite having drilled Oligocene formation. The hole opening began well for 600m and then came to stop. The HO arms were worn to 13 and the 16 stabiliser was damaged. Run was with similar assembly and lasted 200m before stopping up and enduring similar wear to run 1. Roller cone under reamer was used for the next run but stopped after only 10m. No wear was seen on this assembly and it is most likely the stabiliser had hung up in an under gauge hole. PDC UR was used for run but was worn down to 14 after drilling only 20m. Run was made with the same UR as in run but this time the 16 stab was omitted and it drilled 1200m to TD. 16 bit cleanout run followed. Despite abrasive conditions not being anticipated roller cone under reamer should at least be mobilised for long (say 400m +) hole opening runs and should also be considered as the primary tool even if this means several runs.

The well was planned with 1900 horizontal section of which app. 1100 should be 7 liner (transport section) in open hole and 800 with 5/8 Baker Excluder screens. The actual sections installed was transport 5/8 Excluder screen section. The transport section from 5/8 liner shoe to top screen was isolated from the open hole screen section to prevent any X-flow from production interval to depleted zones. The isolation was an app. 400 cemented section in liner/open hole annulus and placed on top of two External Casing Packers. A conventional top completion was run and stung into the liner PBR. An OCRE valve was installed below the production packer to allow setting of the packer and testing the tubing. A down hole gauge was installed just above the production packer. A conventional Baker 7 down hole safety valve was installed @ app. 100m below seabed. The well was not planned to have gas lift installation. 1.2 History The well C-06D was an existing oil producing well, which now has been side- tracked from the 18 5/8 casing to make pilot hole for optimising the drilling trajectory and target. The pilot hole is plugged back and the final horizontal section has been drilled in the ORE formation. 1.3 Executed Operation In summary the following operation was conducted: 1.

Only after entering the Utsira (781 m) did the problem with directional control (10 deg dogleg) occur. Up until this point both directional control and hole cleaning were satifactory. The parameters were 3300 - 4500 lpm, 80 - 120 rpm and 20 m3 bentonite pills were pumped each stand. The inital hole was cement back (Theoretically) to 740 m. Hard cement was tagged at 776 m. On drilling this side track the drop of angle in Utsira was again too much. Dogleg over degrees. This hole was cement back up to the conductor shoe The Third attempt was drilled with seawater with 20 m2 bentonitt pills to 550 m. (This was to reduce the problem with gumbo clay on the shakers.) From 550 Bentonite mud was used to TD in order to help maintain directional control through the Utsira. Full returns through the entire sectionb) Casing/sementering Due to the problems with the directional drilling through the Utsira formation four cement plugs were set. The first (1) was set from 827 to 740 ( tagged hard cement at 776 m). After 33,5 hrs kick off was made but the directional control was not maintained and the BHA dropped over 10 degrees over two stands The second sidetrack involved setting sg plug (2) from 855 . This resulted in stuck pipe and a 144 dp fish left in the hole. From:699 to 843 m. 58. m3 high viscous pill was placed over the fish to 600 m. 200 sg cement plug (3) was placed from 600 to 400 m. Hard cement was tagged at 453 (8 ton).The final 1,95 sg cement plug (3) was set from 450 to 250 . This plug was tagged with tons at 322 after 34 hours. Kick off occured at 331 m. > While drilling with seawater the seawater cement compositions made it unnecessary to pump spacer. J:\\\\BBS\\\\500-BRAG\\\\Final Well Reports\\\\5.

Negative erfaringer Directional control through Utsira.Unable to maintain directional control while drilling the Utsira with seawater. Required to cement back the initial well path and drill the section again with bentonite mud. Hole Cleaning. For directional control while steering max pump rate was 3000 lpm. This causes problems with hole cleaning. Extra time was required to pull up and circulate the hole clean. Casing joints too long. The casing joints sent out to the rig were over meters long. The joints were too long to fit between the legs of the gantry crane on the deck. This makes it much more difficult to move the pipe on the racks. Long setting time for cement. Due to the low temperatures of the top hole section waiting for the kick off plugs to set up took minimum of 24 hours and in the case of the sg set from 450 to 250 total of hours was used before the cement was firm enough. Excessive hole size. The drilling of the 24 hole with deg and deg motors created much larger hole and excess for cement calculations were difficult to predict. Both 40% and 25% excess were used. 5 DP backed off and left in the hole. While setting the cement plug in the first sidetrack at 855 m. the cementing stinger torqued up and required vertical movement to reduce this torque. With the drawworks failing the string became stuck. This resulted in the movement of cement stopping. This created plug in the drill string that 300 bar could not move. 320 ton up weight was pull with out success. The string was backoff with the result that 144 of drill pipe was left in the hole. Two stands of was pulled out of the hole with the 5/8 dp. The high torque values were the result of sg cement , high dogleg and formation. Stage cementing. The pumping of cement in the top hole section should be keep below 200 lengths and preferably in stages.', 'Passage_id': 814}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 31/4-A-22 T2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: B-26 BRAGE 31/4-A-22 Dato: 05.05.2001 Skrevet av: RMJ/ SEKSJONS STRRELSE Siste foringsrr sko dyp : 1216 mMDmTVD TD seksjon : mMD/ mTVD Formasjoner boret : Oligocene sand, Green Clay, Brown Marker, Balder, Sele Objektiver oppfyl : Bit : FM2765DRIw3, XT02DLC, QP 19M. a) Boring : 17 1/2. Though tripping to replace bits twice and an MWD once are not desirable in themselves, side effect of these operations is that they act as wiper trips. The extra trips out of hole ensured enhanced hole cleaning over the original plan and will have positively contributed to favourable hole conditions. Pills were pumped frequently and had positive effects, seen with very noticable increase in cuttings at the shakers when the hi weight pill arrived at surface. Casing was run without La Fleur and Reamer shoe as hole conditions were expected to be good. This proved to be the case, and the casing went into the hole without restrictions all the way to TD. Nothing EP pipe was used for the first time on Brage, and is intended to aid hole cleaning/cutting bed removal. One single was placed in the string every third stand up untill 200m inside the 18 5/8 casing shoe at TD. Effects of this pipe were judged to be good, with little amounts of fines being seen at the shakers. No discernable adverse effects were seen on the ECD.

Objective: The objective was to cut the tubing at 8900' MD, Circulate out the temblock in the annulus, kill the well with sea water, squeeze the perforations with CaCO3-pill, remove the tubing and set an EZSV and cement plug on top of the tubing cut. All this in 10 days. Conclusion: The work was performed in days with only minor operational problems. Recommendations: No change to the procedure. Discussion: Temblock. No restrictions were observed when circulating out the annulus volume due to the temblock placed in the annulus to isolate the tubing leak. Some flakes of temblock were found on the first tubing joints when the tubing was pulled CaCO3 Pill. An large amount of CaCO3 pills was required to kill the well. total of 13 pills, 30 to 40 bbl's, was pumped. The fmal pill consisted of 300 PPB CaCO3 and 130 PPB LCM material (Nutplug, Mica and Kvickseal). Attempt to pull tubing. Due to the tubing collapse an attempt was made to pull the tubing without cutting it.  lbs was applied (max  lbs ovetpull on tubing) without success.

We refer to your lletter of August 18, 1972. This Ministry has decided to grant permission under  37 of the Royal Decree of August 25, 1967 issuing safety regulations etc. for the exploration and drilling for submarine petroleum resources, to moor the platform, provided the mooring is not placed closer than 2,100 feet to the under-sea cable from Kristiansand to Scarborough. It must be ensured that supply ships and the like do not drop anchor wherever they may risk fouling the cable. We moreover request you particularly to note the last paragraph of the aforesaid  37 to the effect that any damage- caused by cables, pipelines or installations etc. shall, regardless of fault, be compensated by the licensee and the contractor whose operations have caused the damage.

This could not be corrected by steering, and at 3940 mMD another short correction run was made. The hole angle was reduced from 92.1 at 3914 mMD to 90.4 at 3970 mMD (2849.8 mTVD). The hole angle was maintained at close to 900 until 4400 mMD. Below 4400 mMD, the hole angle was allowed to stay close to 89 because of high (10 - 20 ohnun) formation resistivities, and this brought the TVD down to 2853.5 at 4606 mMD. thick claystone at 4536 mMD was followed by low resistivity sandstone at 4598 mMD, and so attempts were made to steer the hole back up to the original plan of 9 TVD. These were unsuccessful, and at 4781 mMD, with hole angle of 89.5 and TVD of 2856 m, the bit was pulled. While tripping out, tight spot was reamed at 4310 mMD and at 4002 mMD the bit became stuck with loss of returns. After 30 minutes the string was jarred free. The trip in was difficult with several tight spots (including the area where the string was stuck during the trip out) and occasional packing off. While drilling the next section from 6 mMD, the hole inclination was brought up to 92 degrees. The drillstring stalled out several times, and during the trip out at 4816 mMD the hole had to be bacicreamed from 4780 - 3802 mMD. The hole was particularly tight at 4780 mMD and between 4340 and 4320 mMD (in claystone). While running in, the bottom of the hole was relogged by the MWD tool and at 4813 mMD partial mud losses to the hole occurred and were cured with an LCM pill. The hole was drilled to 5066 mMD, with the inclination maintained at 92 degrees. The trip at 5066 mMD was very tight with the string becoming stuck several times, and at 4053 mMD the string became irretrievably stuck.

No serious drilling problems were encountered during the drilling of this path compared to Ti and T2. The Statfjord Formation was penetrated at 4134 mMD (2844.8 mTVD), and the hole was maintained more or less horizontal at 2852 mTVD.

Upon reaching the Eiriksson Member the well path was either horizontal or building above horizontal. The Eiriksson Member of the Statfjord Formation comprised sandstone, with claystone interbeds. In the AT3 wellpath this member was entered across fault. The sandstone was predominantly loose, clear to translucent, occasionally opaque, fine to very coarse grained, locally very fine grained and occasionally granule size, generally poorly sorted but often moderately sorted, subangular and angular in the upper part but becoming locally subrounded with depth. In the upper part pyrite was common but this became rarer with depth, while there were some traces of feldspar, occasional kaolinitic cement/matrix, trace mica flakes and lithic grains in parts which were generally very coarse to granule sized and grey. In the lower part of the section some pink/rose quartz was seen and the very coarse to granule sized quartz were often opaque and milky. Only minor amounts of rock flour were seen while drilling but from 4110m (A-34 AT3) there were some horizons of calcite cemented sandstone which were seen in samples as off white, soft to firm, crumbly with floating quartz in rock flour/matrix rarely grading to sandy limestone. The claystone interbeds were predominantly medium to medium dark grey, occasionally brownish grey, firm, blocky, non calcareous, micromicaceous, with traces of greyish black claystone which was slightly hard, splintery to platy, non calcareous, micropyritic and very carbonaceous. In the upper part of the section there were some varicoloured claystone interbeds which were moderate to dark reddish brown, olive grey, rarely bluish grey, firm, well indurated, blocky, non calcareous and micromicaceous. Below 5145m (A-34 AT3), the claystone was predominantly greenish grey, occasionally greenish black, firm to slightly soft, slightly soluble and easily washed out of the sample. There was some siltstone in the section, generally at gradational boundaries between the claystones and sandstones. This was generally medium to dark greenish grey, light to medium olive grey, firm to friable, non calcareous, micaceous and sandy in part. A number of faults were proposed along the A-34 AT3 wellpath, which generally correlated with those seen on the two previous tracks A34A and A34AT2.

Top reservoir was penetrated about meter deeper in the heal of the well while it was found about 13 shallower than prognosed in the toe area. Since only the Tarbert Fm. was penetrated in the well and the pressure was expected to be known based on the previous drilled injectors, no pressure measurements were recorded. Initially the production rate was about 1500 Sm3/d, but due to lower reservoir pressure than expected the production rate has varied between 1100 and 1500 Sm3/d.

Completion The well 34/7-C-4 T2H is the drilled and completed by Saga with the SSDR Bideford Dolphin from June to November 1999. It is the 4th and last well on template C, drilled to total depth of 4220 m MD (2449.3 TVD). The primary objective of the completion operations was to complete the well as an Upper Brent (Tarbert Fm) oil producer in Vigdis Middle. The completion solution is 1/2 tapered tubing string was installed in 10 3/4 % casing. The well was perforated in overbalance with drill pipe before installation of the completion string. 718 long interval in the Tarbert Fm, Upper Brent Gp, was perforated. Both the and the liner was perforated. (For details, see Figure 5.1: Completion well schematic) 5.1 Wellhead system The wellhead system is based on standard 18 3/4, 690 bar, ABB Vetco Gray SG-5 system. 5.2 Tubing hanger system An ABB Vetco Gray type tubing hanger is installed, having nominal production bore, nominal annulus bore and working pressure of 345 bar. Both bores are equipped with nipple profile for tubing hanger plug. Three connections in the tubing hanger are provided for connecting to two hydraulic control lines (hydraulic stab) and one electrical line (wet connector). hydraulic control line for TRSCSSV and electrical line for downhole pressure and temperature gauge are installed in this well. 5.3 Subsea tree An ABB Vetco Gray type subsea tree is installed, having bore and working pressure of 345 bar. The subsea tree comprises an 18 3/4 690 bar MD-H4 connector to lock and seal it to the SG-5 wellhead. Stab subs, hydraulic stabs and electrical wet connector on the subsea tree connect, respectively the production bore, annulus bore, TRSCSSV and downhole pressure and temperature gauge to the tubing hanger. Production flow is routed from the choke on the subsea tree, through flowline spool and connector on the lower half of the subsea tree frame, and to the manifold pipework. The choke is bolted to the wing block. It features retrievable actuator, which is accessed via the upper subsea tree frame. The gate valves are hydraulic failclose safety valves rated to 345 bar, with actuators incorporating visual position indicators, except the swab valves, which are manually operated. The subsea tree control pod is retrievable device and is mounted on the opposite side of the choke. The control pod receives hydraulic supply from the manifold structure via the tlowline connector interface. Electric supply and control signals are also routed via the manifold, but connected to the top of the control module with ROV.

RESERVOIR 6.1 Reservoir Geology The oil producer 34/7-C-4 T2H, is located in Vigdis Middle, target is about 0,4 km north-east of exploration well 34/7-19 (Figure 6.1). According to the plan the well penetrated only the Tarbert Fm. of the Brent Gp. The top of the Brent Group was penetrated at 3423 MD RKB/2423 TVD MSL, approximately metres TVD deeper than prognosed, in the heal while it was penetrated approximately 13 metres TVD shallower than prognosed in the toe, i.e. at 4140 MD RKB/2424 TVD MSL. The upper part of the reservoir unit consists of argillaceous, fine grained, occasionally very fine and medium grained, sandstone interbedded with sandy shale stringers. The shale stringers become less abundant towards the top of the unit. The sorting is moderate with subrounded to subangular grains grading to well sorted subangular to angular grains towards the top. The degree of consolidation is generally poor to moderate except some carbonate cemented intervals in the upper part of the unit. The visual porosity is poor. Shows were seen throughout the upper part of the section. Below 3705 (2432 TVD MSL) the reservoir unit mainly consists of very fine to fine grained argillaceous sandstone. The sandstone is well sorted with subangular to subrounded grains. It is commonly loose to friable and occasionally firm due to carbonate cementation. The visual porosity is poor. Shows were seen throughout the sandstone section. A geological cross section along the wellpath is shown in Figure 6.2. Depths and thicknesses are listed in Table 6.1. Note that the calculation of the isochore and isopach thicknesses are highly dependent on the dip of the layers due to high well inclination through the Brent Gp. An average structural dip of 3/210 was used for the Brent Group.

The seismic source employed for the N.I. survey was two sleeve guns with total volume of 300 cu.ins, depth and air pressure of 2000 psi. The following levels were recorded (m MD RKB) Run 1, NI Run 2, NI Level spacing 10 10 In total, 278 levels were recorded of which 269 levels were included in the VSP processing and check shot computation. A composite display consisting of VSP upgoing wavefield spliced into surface seismic (SG9701) is shown in Figure 6.3. The tie between the VSP and the seismic is good. Synthetic Seismogram READ has applied check shot calibrated velocity logs and density logs from the well to generate synthetic seismograms. zero phase version of synthetic seismogram as well as sonic, density and impedance logs are displayed together with surface seismic random line from SG970I along the well path in Figure 6.4. Map updating The well penetrated the base Cretaceous unconformity and the top of the Brent reservoir deeper than prognosed. The BCU in the toe of the well was penetrated approximately 13 shallower than prognosed. The Charisma picks of the interpretations are confirmed by the check shot values within range of milliseconds. Figures illustrate the interpretation along the well. No adjustments have been done to the time interpretation of the reflectors. The well results are integrated in the new depth grids based on interpretation of the SG9701 survey. A summary of formation tops, co-ordinates, and seismic positions is given in Table 6.2.

Petrophysics 7.1 Log Interpretation 7.1.1 Log Operations and Data Quality The reservoir section was drilled with an bit and OBM (Oil Base Mud), Nova Plus synthetic with density of g/cc. The maximum recorded temperature was 94 degC and the maximum hole deviation in the interval is degrees. 7.1.2 Log Analysis The Cromer Knoll and the Brent Group have been analysed using the Recall programme. True vertical depth is calculated with algorithms correcting for the well path penetrating the formation. The input parameters for the analysis are listed in Table below. The computer processed interpretation (CPI) of the reservoir zones is presented in Figure 7.1. Schlumberger MWD/LWD logs (DGR-EWR-SLD-CND) has been used as input logs to the petrophysical evaluation. No environmental corrections have been performed on the input logs. The following curves have been used: SGRC  GAMMA (API), SEDP  Deep Resistivity (Ohm m), SPLF  Neutron (fraction), SBDC  Bulk Density (g/cc) Shale volume has been estimated using the Density/Neutron crossplot. The shale parameters have been chosen from the logs and are presented in Table 7.1. Shale corrected effective porosity has been calculated from the density curve. Matrix parameters are presented in Table 7.1. No core analysis or special core analysis has been done. The water saturation has been computed using the Indonesia equation. Water saturation in the invaded zone has been calculated using the relation Sxo = Si, 45 which is established from the Tordis field. The cementation factor m, and the saturation exponent n, has been chosen to = = 2. Formation water resistivity R. of Ohm at 20 C, which has been used in the evaluation, was obtained from test in well 34/7-19 (ref.: Final Well Report 34/7-B-I AH). Net sand has been computed using cut-offs defined in the Vigdis Plan for Development and Operation. The cut-off defined, is presented in Table 7.1. mentnin: AVellsNigtlis/34_7-C-4 HIEtierarbeid/FIVR 44', 'Passage_id': 865}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 34/7-C-4 H \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Saga Petroleum a.s.

This causes the pressure pulse called pretest drawdown. The combination off low rate and snorkel determines an effective range of operation. The maximum drawdown pressure pulse can be determined from the well-known spherical flow equation where APdd is the final drawdown pressure differential at time t=oo.

Exact Mobility Analysis By analyzing the drawdown curve and the build-up curve it is possible to calculate the mobility of the formation. The mobility is defined as the permeability divided by the viscosity (md/cp). Therefore if the viscosity of the fluid being drawn is known, it is also possible to determine the formation permeability. The fluid being drawn into the pretest is normally assumed to be the mud filtrate so if the mud type is known it is possible to estimate the filtrate viscosity. The two methods of determining the mobility are shown by the two equations below. First is the drawdown mobility Mdd that uses the drawdown pressure differential (i.e.,APdd=Pstop-Pdd_end) and is the most common method used in the industry. It is normally referred to as the steady-state spherical method. The second is the exact spherical mobility Mexact that typically uses the buildup curve. simplified form of the exact method is shown in Figure-1 which is an exponential with magnitude of (3 (pressure, psi) and time constant of a(sec). Both the drawdown and buildup curves can be analyzed but normally the buildup is used. The curve fit parameters alpha and beta (3 are used to determine the mobility. Generally these Mdd and Mexact are very similar except in low mobility zones where the mobility is < md/cp. In this case the Exact method yields the most accurate estimate of Mobility. 14,696q o Mdd=  __   Drawdown spherical mobility (md/cp) 2   dd    -  14,696    z  tp   1- 27r   rp  Exact spherical mobility (md/cp)', 'Passage_id': 904}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6406/3-H-3 AHT2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Confidential Page 105 Flow Rate Determination There are three methods of determining the drawdown (and pumping) flow rates which can be selected in the Job Parameters. In the newer tools the flow rate is measured and the Automatic Method is the preferred default. In older tools the flow rate or test volume can be specified but the values must be entered manually. With any of these three options it is rare that the volumes and rates exactly match that specified by the engineer since there is variability in the actual execution of pretest and the rates and volume in RTS are determined from actual events and measured data. Automatic Flow Rate Option The automatic flow rate option determines rate from the measured rate curve(s) directly. For pretesting the averaged rate between the selected starting and ending times of the drawdown is used (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd). It is possible to select Tend_dd that may not fall within the drawdown period and still estimate the mobility using the averaged rate for the drawdown period chosen. When this happens the simulated drawdown curve is turned off. For both pumping and pretesting the rate should be determined from the active rate curves. Since some tools like the RDT can have more than one pretest module or pump the total average from all the rate curves are used to for the Automatic Rate calculation. Then the volume for the drawdown is determined by using this averaged rate times the drawdown time (i.e., AvgRate/(Tend_dd-Tstart_dd)). However, the time used to average should not exceed 30 minutes which would apply to pumpouts or miniDST testing and it is desirable to determine the rate just prior to the buildup. In this case the averaged rate would be from Tdd-30 minutes to Tdd. Also, rates less than cc/sec from Meas PT Rate are filtered out (set to values) and rates less than cc/sec for Pump Rates are set to before averaging. Manual Flow Rate Option With this option selection in the Job Parameters the rate is fixed to the value entered. The volume of the pretest is determined by multiplying this rate time the drawdown time period selected (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd). Manual Volume Option With this option selection in the Job Parameters the volume is fixed to the value entered. The rate of the pretest is determined by dividing this volume by the drawdown time period selected (i.e., Tstard_dd and Tend_dd).', 'Passage_id': 905}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/7-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: ROBERTSON RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL LIMITED Project No. IIA/778/1161 INTRODUCTION The maturation of kerogen during diagenesis has been described by a number of workers, of whom Correia (1967 and 1971), Staplin (1969) and Gutjahr (1966) have referred specifically to modifications of sporopollenin. One effect of maturation processes on sporopollenin is to increase the visible colour density from pale yellow, through orange and brown to black. The determinative procedures outlined by Staplin (1969) have been largely followed in this study, except that ten- point scale of colour indices has been utilised rather than the scale proposed by Staplin. This is considered to provide more consistent colour index : temperature relationship. Sixteen samples from the interval 3490m - 3775m of the Norsk Hydro 30/7-6 Norwegian North Sea well were prepared for spore colour analysis. The results of the examination and our interpretation of these results are presented below. II RESULTS The results of spore colouration analysis may be grouped into Romp!!', 'Passage_id': 906}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/7-6 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: intervals of zones of maturity. Within certain of these zones anomalous results have been observed as described below: INTERVAL 3490m-3620m Spore colouration values in this section range from to and are indicative of marginally to early mature sediments. Wide ranges of spore colour values were noted with indices as high as 5.5. INTERVAL 3635m-3705m The samples from this interval are characterised by extremely variable spore colour values, although the average value of in situ material is 4.5-5.5. This value is indicative of mature sediments. SAMPLE 3720m It has not proved possible to produce an accurate assessment of the maturation level of this sample, as insufficient positively in situ palynomorphs were recorded. value of +5 is determinable from the available sporopollenin, indicative of mature sediments. INTERVAL 3735m-3775m Although variable spore colouration values were again recorded from this section, with some indices as high as 8, the overall spore colouration values average to 6.5. This is indicative of well mature sediments. III CONCLUSIONS The results of these analyses suggest that the section is organically mature below +3600m, and that at the base of the interval examined post-mature sediments have not been penetrated. High variations in spore colour values, as observed in this well, are commonly attributed to localised heating, such as hydrothermal activity in aquifers. The maturation gradient indicates an unusually rapid increase in temperature relative to depth. From the available evidence it has not been possible to identify the cause of this phenomenon.

The MDT run (Run 1A) was performed to obtain formation pressures and acquire formation fluid samples using Large-Diameter probe (LDP). Live Fluid Analyzer (LFA) was used for fluid identification. The formation pressure was evaluated from 1869.5m MD to 1883.5m MD. Six gas samples were acquired during this run. Permanent datum is Mean Sea Level. All Wireline depth measurements were referenced to the drill floor which was located 40 above Mean Sea Level. Station file no. & were depth corrected by +2.6m in hindsight, so that depths for all stations were correlated with VSP down log dated 1st of April 2014, which was consistent on depth with the LWD Ecoscope log dated 23rd of March 2014. Pretests Interpretation Summary Formation pressure was evaluated at 10 stations, pressure measurements were performed before and after sampling in one of these stations. All pretests were processed and evaluated using InSitu Pro software. Only data from the quartz gauge was used for interpretation, although the strain gauge compared well with the quartz gauge. Test qualities and color codes were distributed as:  High  Low (1 Supercharged and Unstabilized)  Ungraded (Tight) Gradient Interpretation Summary No meaningful gradient can be concluded due to limited amount of valid pressure measurements. A mud gradient corresponding to density of g/cm3 was calculated from the hydrostatic pressure reading of all test points. This value compared well with the mud density of g/cm3 stated in the mud report. Sampling Station Summary Station (1877.5m MD): total volume of 61 was pumped out from formation at this depth using LDP. Six MPSR bottles (SN: 2825, 4213, 4222, 4681, 2530 & 4672) were filled. The sampled fluid is predicted to be gas.

The StethoScope tool used during Run is in collar with the probe and setting piston located on in stabilizer. The bit size on the BHA was in and the StethoScope probe to bit offset was m. The well objectives are to maximize the Net Present Value; maximize the recovery and maximize the availability. The StethoScope operation will allow to identify the net reservoir to optimize the completion and determine pressure in the Egga formation for dynamic model calibration. C-2 AH production well will be drilled from C-2 pilot hole to have 80 reservoir length. The StethoScope data was acquired in one run; Run 2. 14 tests were evaluated on the 16th of April 2013, resulting in 10 Good Quality tests, Medium Quality test and No Seal tests. All tests were fixed-rate type 0-D. The upper portion of the ream up pass was used as the depth correlation pass. The ream up pass was performed over the interval 3070  3205 m, but the correlation interval has been chosen over the interval detailed below. The resulting offset with the drilling/reference log was applied to probe depths when positioning the StethoScope to match the requested depth from drilling/reference log. CORRELATION PASS INTERVAL OFFSET WITH DRILLING/REFERENCE LOG PRETESTS OFFSET APPLIED TO All tests were taken after reaching TD. The mud used during the StethoScope operation was WBM with density of sp.gr. for Run 2. The reported mobilities are computed from the drawdown and build up curves using the method outlined in the appendix which can be found on the CD. The mobility range for all valid tests was to mD/cP. 1.2 Interpretation Summary RUN Good Quality Pretests Pretests 2, to 11,13 and 14: Reached stable pressure.

As the actual formation and fluids that will be encountered is uncertain and therefore number of cases are considered. For cases where the RCI tool is configured with snorkel, an analytical model for spherical source with storage and skin is used to generate the pressure response. The skin is adjusted to take into account the actual geometry of the probe and wellbore and includes corrections for anisotropy. Spherical permeability, kxyz, is defined as the geometric average of the three principle permeabilities (two horizontal, lc, = ky = kxy, and one vertical, kz): k =Vickykz =311k2 xyz The results of the different cases are intended to help in the understanding of the nature of the pressure and rate responses so that, during the RCI job itself, the optimum conditions for pressure testing and sampling are achieved.

Any significant differences are noted. The reservoir quality of the sandstones is subsequently outlined, and the controls on reservoir quality, at various scales, are described and evaluated. The petrographical evaluation is based on the analysis of 18 thin-sections from cores 1-9, from core 10 and sidewall core samples. Additionally, SEM and XRD were undertaken on of these samples (see App. Table I.1 for details). further thin-sections were prepared from sidewall cores, but they were not analysed due to the extensive shattering resulting from the sampling method. Detailed modal analysis results are presented in Appendix Table III.1, and mean values quoted are for the total petrographical sample set (App. Table modal analysis = 25, textural analysis = 24). Sandstone classification and texture The sandstones classify as arkosic, subarkosic and sublithic (Fig. 5A.), plotting fairly close together, and the grouping is even tighter on the chemical stability plot (Fig. 5B), indicating very low lithic content for these sandstones. Texturally they are predominantly fine grained sandstones, ranging from very fine to medium grained, and from moderately to moderately well sorted (Fig. 5C). The sorting values derived from textural analysis are rather better than was anticipated during core logging, where grain size comparison was difficult due to the range of grain sizes present. Sieve analysis is also being undertaken (BP fide), which may more accurately quantify the range in grain sizes (coarser grains which are prone to fracturing and dissolution, are not quantified using the petrographical technique, see App. II). The samples are also generally clean (Fig. 5E-I) with detrital clay content of typically <10% except in the debris flow sandstones (Fig. 5D) where abundances are up to 35.5% (ADF, 3099.17mdd). The other notable textural feature of sandstones from cores 1-9 is the very open, uncompacted fabric (Fig. 5E-G, I, J), very different from the compacted fabric with grain suturing and long grain contacts seen in the samples from core 10 (Fig. 5H) and the sidewall core samples. Detrital mineralogy The sandstones are dominated by framework grains (mean 74%; App. Table 111.2) with subordinate ductiles (mean 15%; except for one lithotype S13 sandstone which contains 48% carbonaceous matter). Typically monocrystalline quartz is the dominant framework grain (mean 56%), with subordinate K-feldspar (mean 7%), polycrystalline quartz (mean 6%) and Badley, Ashton & Associates Ltd /1', 'Passage_id': 922}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6707/10-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: PETROGRAPHYY AND RESERVOIR QUALITY EVALUATION 6707/10-1 plagioclase (mean 3%). Chert (1.5%), sedimentary rock fragments (2.0%), other rock fragments (<2.0%, typically quartz/feldspar or quartz/mica aggregates) and heavy minerals (.1.0) are commonly present. Rare sponge spicules and reworked aeolian grains are also present in trace abundances, and these may be of some value as provenance indicators. The ductile components are generally dominated by detrital clay (mean 8%), which is typically sparsely developed and has an illitic composition (App. Table 111.2) although locally glauconite grains are more abundant (mean 3%, max. 9.5%). Muscovite (4.5%), biotite (1.5%), and mudclasts (3.0%) are commonly present, and carbonaceous matter is generally minor phase except in lithotype S13 sandstones, which are defined on its presence. Authigenic mineralogy and paragenesis Authigenic minerals are typically developed in low abundance within these sandstones (mean 11%, 3.0-40.5%; App. Table 111.2), with the exception of siderite which is locally extensively developed. Siderite is ubiquitous, and varies in abundance from to 37.0%. It is generally developed as an anhedral to euhedral microcrystalline cement phase with crystals ranging up to c.50j.tm across typically lining pores, and as a displacive phase associated with micas. Where extensively developed it also replaces detrital clay. It appears to be relatively early phase, and is locally enclosed by quartz overgrowths. XRD analysis indicates that the composition is highly variable (see App. III). Ferroan dolomite (0.0-15.0%) is locally developed as microcrystalline cement phase which is intimately associated with microcrystalline siderite. It also occurs as scattered euhedral crystals or clusters of crystals which locally constrict or block pore-throats. The timing of this phase is not well constrained although it post-dates the onset of feldspar grain dissolution, and locally encloses authigenic quartz. Pyrite (0.0-3.0%) commonly occurs associated with plant fragments, glauconite grains or micas, where it is typically framboidal. It also forms at grain margins replacing detrital clay. Authigenic quartz (0.0-2.5%) is present as thin, impersistent syntaxial overgrowths which rarely show euhedral terminations. They can be difficult to distinguish from reworked overgrowths which are locally present, but this is not thought to be significant in terms of the accuracy of the modal analysis data. In SEM quartz overgrowths can be seen to enclose microcrystalline siderite rhombs. Kaolinite (0.0-1.5%) is very minor phase which locally occurs as clusters of booklets (platelets c.10-25m across) which pseudomorph framework grains and 'spill out' into adjacent primary macropores. It is also present as dense, coarsely crystalline phase which is replacive after micas. Locally it is cross- cut by ferroan dolomite. A bladed precipitate with stellate form was identified by SEM within one sample (#108). No elemental analysis could be obtained, and it is possible that this is precipitate associated with the extensive salt contaminant. There is faint possibility, however, that it may represent some form of zeolite. Para genesis Due to the typically low abundance of the authigenic phases few paragenetic relationships have been identified, and detailed diagenetic scheme cannot be proposed. However, microcrystalline siderite appears to be the first phase to precipitate, as it is locally enclosed by authigenic quartz.

The timing of kaolinite is uncertain, and that of ferroan dolomite is equivocal as conflicting evidence is recorded, suggesting that it occurs both pre and post-dating authigenic quartz. It may have precipitated at more than one time. Poroperm characteristics of the sandstones The porosity and permeability are described in terms of the total core analysis dataset, while the petrographical controls are evaluated from the modal analysis dataset, which is considered to be representative. Overall, the reservoir quality of the cored interval is good to excellent, with strong positive correlation between increasing porosity and increasing permeability (Fig. 6A). There are two distinct poroperm groups, with common poor quality 'tail'.  the upper group is composed entirely of samples from cores 1-9. Within it the best quality sandstones are lithotype Sm which typically have porosities of 26-36% 0He and permeability of 300-8000mD Kh . The lithotypes Smp, Sd, Si and Sr typically plot within the range 22-36% 0He and 100-4000mD (Fig. 6). These sandstones form the bulk of the high quality grouping.  the lower group is composed of sandstones from core 10, and covers range in porosity values from c.14-20% and of permeability values of 5- 60mD, considerable reduction in reservoir quality from the samples in cores 1-9. There is no clear variation in reservoir quality between lithotypes within the group, although the Sd sandstones tend to have slightly higher porosity values than the Sm and Smp sandstone.  the poor quality 'tail' extends downwards from the upper group, and is composed of lithotypes including the mud-rich ADF, UDF, and M, and sand-prone lithotypes Sm, SI, Sd, Sb and Sr. Only lithotype Smp sandstones are not represented. There is no obvious difference between the samples from cores 1-9 and those from core 10 within this group except that no samples from core 10 occur with porosities and permeabilities better than those seen in the lower poroperm group. Controls on reservoir quality These are described at varying scales ranging from the interval to the microscopic. Compaction Tne significant decrease in both porosity and permeability between the sandstones in core 1-9 and those in core 10 is due to the increased effects of compaction, which are evident microscopically (Fig. 6, note long grain contacts in the photomicrograph, compared with the open, uncompacted fabric of all other photomicrographs), and can be demonstrated by the reduction in interparticle volume as illustrated in Figure 7. It cannot be ascertained on the basis of the samples examined whether this compaction is gradual effect increasing with depth or whether there is threshold depth beneath which compaction is marked. However, as the sidewall cores are representative of number of different sandbodies, the increased compaction is not restricted to particular horizon. It is noteworthy that the sidewall core samples all have interparticle volumes which plot within the range of those from the samples from core 10. This is partially function of variation between lithotypes. There is no evidence of increased quartz cementation within the samples from core 10, although the Badley, Ashton & Associates Ltd 13\", 'Passage_id': 924}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6707/10-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: long and locally sutured grain contacts would suggest silica dissolution. Potentially silica has been exported from the system, which may have been precipitated up structure. Mineralogical controls The sandstones are largely uncemented throughout, but there are locally important cements and detrital clays. The two phases which are primarily responsible for degrading porosity and permeability within these typically cement poor sandstones are detrital clay and siderite cement. Detrital clay is typically minor phase within the sandstones, but where it occurs in moderate abundance (Fig. 6F, detrital clay 13%) it does reduce both porosity and to greater extent permeability, and where abundant, within the debris flow deposits (ADF and UDF) it has significant effect (Fig. 8A, B). Siderite is also variably abundant and is the other main degrader of reservoir quality. Its presence does not appear to be sedimentologically controlled (Ends and 2) but it does locally occur associated with detrital clay, (sampled lithotypes ADF, UDF). Increasing abundance of microcrystalline siderite shows good correlation with both decreasing porosity and permeability (Fig. 8C, D). It is the presence and variable abundance of these two phases in combination which control the distribution of samples within the poor quality 'tail' on the porosity/permeability cross-plot. Plug scale variability The dewatered sandstones have been subdivided on the basis of the structures which have been produced by dewatering process (see End. and Fig. 2) and core plugs have been coded as undifferentiated (Sd) where the fabrics recognised in core are not identifiable within the core plug. It is apparent in thin-section that dewatering of sandstones can produce pipes/sheets which are slightly coarser grained than the host sandstone, and which are clay free (Fig. 6C). These might be expected to improve the pore connectivity, but their influence at larger scale is difficult to estimate. While there is no consistent variation in reservoir quality between the dewatering types within the samples from cores 1-9, within the samples from core 10 the lithotype Sd1 sandstones (consolidation laminae) have consistently higher horizontal permeability than the Sd2 (dish structures) sandstones (Fig. 9A); the variation in quality is from c.10-50mD within the Sdl sandstones to c.1-3mD in the Sd2 sandstones. similar reduction is also seen within the vertical permeability (Fig. 9B). There is no consistent variation in reservoir quality between the subtypes of lithotype Si sandstones (App. IV). 14 Badley, Ashton & Associates Ltd\", 'Passage_id': 925}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6707/10-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: S RESERVOIR IMPLICATIONS Reservoir implications are discussed below, from the large-scale architecture of the complex, through variations in vertical connectivity to the small-scale textural and diagenetic controls. The following pertinent points can be made:  clastic input from the Early Santonian to Early Campanian is represented by sheet sand complex comprising number of high net-to-gross sheeted systems, each up to several hundred metres in thickness. These are separated by hemipelagic mudstones (typically 1-10's of thick), which based on evidence from the well are thought likely to form laterally extensive barriers to large scale vertical permeability  these sand systems have an internal architecture of stacked sheet sand elements. Each element is at the tens-of-metre scale. The elements are envisaged to pass laterally and distally into fringe facies of thinner sandstones with mudclasts and carbonaceous-rich caps which increase the reservoir heterogeneity and reduces net-to-gross. Greater well control is, however, required to establish more reliable model of the internal architecture, for example one of laterally-offset or vertical stacking patterns.  greater amalgamation (scouring and channelisation) of the sheet sand deposits is envisaged up depositional-dip, improving both net-to-gross and vertical connectivity.  unattached debris flow deposits in the cored section occur at the sub- metre scale within low-density turbidite and hemipelagic intervals. This type of deposit can show considerable thickness variations laterally. This may impact on correlations. Very large scale failures, if present, would have the potential to affect sand distribution. The mud-prone sandstone matrix and high mudclast content results in low permeabilities, and therefore these are potential baffles/barriers.  vertical heterogeneity scheme has been applied to the cored and intervening uncored intervals (Encl. 2) to quantify the variations in vertical connectivity. The packages are coded from to with improving connectivity of the sandstones; function of reducing thickness of intercalated heterolithics and shale, bed top character, and amalgamation. A description of each heterogeneity type and the associated reservoir implications are summarised in Figure 3.  within cores 1-9 the reservoir quality is typically good to excellent (c.30% porosity, c.600mD horizontal permeability; Fig. 6) whilst within core 10 there is significant reduction in both porosity and permeability to moderate to good reservoir quality (c.16% porosity, c.12mD horizontal permeability; Fig. 6). This is function of compaction. It is uncertain from this study if there is linear decrease in reservoir quality with depth or whether there is threshold beneath which compaction is significant. Log porosity does, however, show progressive decline with depth through the K80 interval and there is some evidence that there is slightly different porosity-depth trend within the K70.

Where it is abundant, siderite destroys both porosity and permeability.  where glauconite is abundant, minor reduction in reservoir quality is envisaged with depth due to its ductile nature aiding enhanced compaction. 16 Badley, Ashton & Associates Ltd', 'Passage_id': 927}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6707/10-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH:  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The cored and intervening uncored intervals of well 6707/10-1 have penetrated basin-floor sheet sand complex over 1250m in thickness, which can be characterised as follows:  considering the sandstones at large scale, the succession can be separated in two, comprising upper and lower sandbodies of 830 and 300m thicknesses respectively, separated by mudstone interval of over 100 in thickness.  these sand bodies can be broken down into sheet sand systems attaining over 200 in thickness separated by 1-40m of low-density turbidite heterolithics and hemipelagic shales. Trends within the gamma-ray log suggest gradual progradation, aggradation and abandonment, with the greatest amalgamation of sands occurring at the centre of the bow-shaped gamma-ray signature; the period of maximum sediment input.  internally, individual systems are composed of elements, tens of metres in thickness, of stacked high-density turbidite sheet and sheet fringe sandstones.  within cores 1-9, individual, metre thick, high-density turbidite sheet sands grade into carbonaceous 'slurried' caps or attached debris flow deposits rich in carbonaceous matter and mudclasts; intercalated heterolithics also occur within certain intervals. This overall hierarchical depositional make-up results in 'layered' system consisting of number of vertical heterogeneities (Fig. 3).  core 10 is composed of highly amalgamated sheet sands, function of either confinement, basin gradient, or position within the system at this deeper stratigraphic level.  glauconite occurs disseminated throughout the entire succession but is concentrated within certain intervals, which have notable cross- stratified character to the bed tops. These deposits occur above U- burrowed (firm substrate) siltstone interpreted as rafted block derived from failed slope or canyon wall; perhaps precursor to accessing different sediment source. Note that the origin of this unit is not clarified by biostrat, heavy mineral or petrographic data.  unattached debris flows, comprising clay-prone sandstone rich in mudclasts, occur at the sub-metre scale, within packages of low-density turbidites and hemipelagics within the upper cored interval (cores 1-9). These deposits are likely to show rapid lateral thickness variations.  reduction in reservoir quality between cores 1-9 (typically 30% porosity and 1000mD horizontal permeability) and core 10 (17% porosity and 20mD horizontal permeability) is function of compaction.  significant cementation occurs only in the form of very localised siderite. Quartz cementation is negligible.

For this reason future wells drilled in this area should include core sampling strategy to allow an understanding of sandbody geometry and architecture within the sheet sandstone complex.  in order to investigate whether compaction has threshold depth or occurs in linear trend, future wells should also include sampling strategy to recover either more spot cores or rotary sidewall cores, regularly distributed over depth range which includes that similar to the uncored interval between cores 1-9 and core 10 of this well.  additional vertical core plug samples should be targeted within the different types of bed tops (to include S12, S13, Sr, Sb and ADF lithotypes) to allow an improved quantification of the variation in vertical permeability. Plug failure within these poorly consolidated sandstones may prove problematical, especially within the more laminated types of bed top. Whole-core permeability analysis may reduce the number of failures and improve the validity of measurements. 18 Badley, Ashton & Associates Ltd', 'Passage_id': 929}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6707/10-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Genetic Package Vertical Heterogeneity Example Depth (mid) Core Gamma Ray API lso Wireline Response Brief Description/interpretation Reservoir Implications Summary I 8. cc To = 73 Sa 4130 low blocky gamma ray response of very thin, very narrow serrations (45-60 API).

Such sandstones can be difficult to interpret in isolation and can be formed in wide variety of depositional environments including fluvial. deltaic and marine settings. Detailed facies analysis of this interval does, however, suggest that the Gam Formation represents deposition within marine setting, primarily by deposition from relatively high energy unidirectional currents carrying bedload of sand and granule material in the form of small dunes, megaripples and ripples. The marine setting for these sands is most strongly suggested by the presence of trace fossils within the finest grained sandstones. These include Skolithos and Ophiomorpha traces which are most commonly interpreted as representing nearshore sedimentary environment (Pollard et al., 1993). Both burrow types are characterised by mud-lined burrow form, produced to increase the strength of the burrow wall in medium of unconsolidated and often rapidly shifting sand. Other indeterminate burrows within the cored interval also have mud-lined or mud-filled form (including possible Rosselia isp.), and are consistent with this interpretation. Burrow systems such as Macaronichnus. which are unequivocally marine in origin, are not recognised within the core but are likely to have low preservation potential in such coarse grained sediments. Other direct indications of marine setting are less evident from the core. Regional considerations, however, suggest that intervals of the Gam Formation with very similar character to those described here pass laterally into unequivocal marine facies over relatively short distances. In addition, palynological and micropalaeontological evidence from in situ argillaceous material within the Gam Formation of several wells in the Mid Norway area is strongly suggestive of marine origin (RRI, 1997). Thin argillaceous laminae and mud-rich burrow linings and fills were sampled during the course of the study and should be analysed to determine the presence or absence of marine microfossils. Alternative interpretations of the Garn Formation as fluvial sandbody (Harris, 1989), partly fluvial sandbody (Ehrenberg et al., 1992) or fan deltaic unit (Gjelberg et al., 1987) rely on the bedding characteristics of the sandstones, the local coarse grained nature of the sands and the recognition of coals and rarely root traces. Although some of the bedding characteristics of Garn Formation sandstones can be interpreted as channel-like, channels are not exclusive to non-marine or fluvial environments. Similarly, the grain size and sorting of sandstone unit are not diagnostic of the depositional setting but rather of the energy of sedimentary processes and the nature of sediment supply. Coarse grained, moderately well to poorly sorted sandstones can accumulate in nearshore marine environments. No in situ coals have been identified in the Gam Formation of released wells in the Mid Norway area (RRI. 1997), and in all cases apparent coals represent coalified wood material. Such woody material is locally abundant (as in the lower parts of Core in well 6507/6-2), but this does not preclude marine origin although it does suggest relatively proximal or nearshore setting. Root traces are extremely rare in the Gam Formation, and no unequivocal examples are known from released wells in the Mid Norway area. In at least some cases, thin-walled Skolithos burrows can be misidentified as root traces. Roots and burrows can be differentiated by the nature of the wall of the trace, roots having carbonaceous wall and burrows an argillaceous lining. Even if some unequivocal root traces are found within the Garn Formation this can be taken as an unequivocal indicator of subaerial exposure, but not of fluvial origin. Well developed root traces and palaeosols are known from unequivocal marine sequences from the Palaeozoic to Recent (Wright and Peters, 1989; Braithwaite, 1983), and indicate periods of episodic emergence. As noted above, the majority of the sandstones within the cored interval of the Gam Formation in well 6507/6-2 were deposited by migrating bedforms developed in response to relatively high energy Page 18', 'Passage_id': 935}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-7 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: LITHOLOGY AND LITHOFACIES LITHOLOGIC CHARACTER The core material from the Phillips 2/4 7X well is composed of yellowish brown chalk and very light gray to white, partially silicified chalk. The major components of the chalk are micrograined, calcareous, coccolithophorid material and traces to very common silica. The chalks also contain traces to very rare (less than 5%) clay minerals, pyrite, macrograined skeletal debris and chalk clasts. Primary bedding, although commonly indistinct, typically ranges from thin to very thick and frequently exhibits low-angle (10-20 degrees) inclination. Bedding-parallel planar lamination and wavy lamination are the most common primary sedimentary structures. The more common massive chalks, those that contain no primary internal structure, typically contain weak to moderate mottling representative of bioturbation and burrowing. Recognizable burrow forms include Chondrites, Planolites, and Zoophycos. The section exhibits only minor stylolitization. LITHOFACIES Our work with chalk cores indicates that chalks can be subdivided into eleven lithofacies (Table II) that are likely to be important in terms of the tectonic, stratigraphic, sedimentologic, diagenetic history of chalk sections and to also have significance in terms of reservoir behavior.

The laminated chalk facies is typically light gray to yellowish brown in color, well-indurated, and hard, although hardness is variable. Chalks in this lithofacies are generally medium bedded and contain common, thin, planar- parallel laminations, with bedding commonly defined by the presence/absence of laminations. Laminated chalks carbonate mudstones composed of calcareous mud and devoid of framework material. Quartz content is typically less than percent in the Tor and lower Ekofisk, but may range up to 20 percent in the upper half of the Ekofisk. Their clay-mineral content is less than percent. Laminated chalks seldom exhibit reservoir quality porosity. Burrowed Laminated Chalk Facies. Burrowed laminated chalk sections are weakly burrowed sections of laminated chalk. They are usually light gray to yellowish brown in color, well-indurated, and hard, although hardness is somewhat variable. Bedding, which is most commonly defined by variability in the degree of burrowing, ranges from thin to very thick. These chalks exhibit common, planar to somewhat wavy parallel laminations disrupted by rare to common Planolites and Chondrites burrows. Burrowed laminated chalks are typically carbonate mudstones composed of calcareous mud devoid of framework material. Quartz content ranges from 10 to 35 percent in the Hod and upper Ekofisk, but is typically less than percent in the Tor and lower Ekofisk. Burrowed laminated chalk sections contain occasional, poor reservoir quality porosity. Homogeneous Chalk Facies. The Homogeneous chalk lithofacies is distinct in its uniformity in character. It is typically yellowish brown to dark yellowish brown or very rarely light gray in color, well-indurated, and very commonly soft to occasionally somewhat hard. Generally primary bedding is absent, or at best, difficult to recognize. Their massive (lack of any internal structure) nature is essential to their definition, although occasional, very rare burrows may occur in some thinner Homogeneous chalk units. These chalks are typically uniform calcareous mudstones containing little or no framework material. One to four percent quartz and to percent clay minerals are common in the Tor and lower Ekofisk formations, whereas, to 15 percent quartz and to percent clay minerals are more representative of the lower Ekofisk. The Homogeneous chalk facies commonly contain very good reservoir porosity; frequently the best reservoir porosities that occur in chalk section are associated with Homogeneous chalk. Burrowed Homogeneous Chalk Facies. Burrowed Homogeneous chalks are Homogeneous chalks that exhibit minor burrowing. They are usually yellowish brown to light gray in color, well-indurated, and hard to moderately soft. If primary bedding can be recognized, it occurs in the medium to thick range. These chalks are generally massive, but containing very rare to rare (to very occasionally common), burrow structures (most commonly Chondrites and Planolites) and burrow mottling. Burrowed Homogeneous chalks are calcareous mudstones that contain little, if any, framework material.

In the Hod and lower Ekofisk, quartz contents of to 10 percent are more typical. Burrowed Homogeneous chalks exhibit occasional reservoir quality porosity. Pebble Floatstone Fades. Chalks in the Pebble Floatstone Facies are typically calcareous mudstones to wackestones (and very rarely packstones) containing rare to locally abundant, high-sphericity, round, sand- to pebble-sized chalk clasts. Pebble Floatstones are typically yellowish brown in color, well-indurated, and hard. Primary bedding, when recognized, ranges from medium to thick and is usually defined by clast content and texture. They are either massive or exhibit normal graded bedding. Quartz and clay mineral contents are low (1 to 3% and less than 1%, respectively) in this lithofacies, based on data available only from the Tor Formation. Argillaceous Chalk Fades. Argillaceous chalks are hard, well indurated, olive gray to gray, fairly argillaceous, carbonate mudstones. They are typically thin to medium bedded, ale commonly thinly interbedded with other chalk lithotypes, and usually exhibit somewhat discontinuous, wavy-parallel laminations and rare to locally common burrowing (primarily Chondrites and Planolites). Bedding is usually defined by variability in the clay mineral content. Quartz contents within Argillaceous chalk beds typically range from 15 to 35 percent, with the clay mineral content ranging from to as much as 20 percent. Argillaceous chalks seldom demonstrate any significant reservoir quality porosity. Burrowed Argillaceous Chalk Fades. Burrowed argillaceous chalks are Argillaceous chalks that have been strongly burrowed; it is one of the most distinctive and easily recognizable lithofacies that occurs within the chalk section. Colors within this lithofacies are somewhat variable, ranging from light olive gray, to yellowish brown, to medium and dark gray. Burrowed argillaceous chalks typically occur as well- indurated, hard, thin to very thick bedded, argillaceous, carbonate mudstones, that exhibit common to abundant burrow structures (Planolites, Chondrites, Zoophycos) and relict wavy-parallel lamination. Their quartz content ranges from 15 to 35 percent, whereas their clay mineral content occurs in the range of to 12 percent. Reservoir quality porosities have not been identified within the Burrowed Argillaceous chalk fades. Calcarenite Fades. Calcarenites occur sporadically within the chalk section as thin to medium bedded (typically single bed less than 30 cm thick), normally graded and occasionally planar- or ripple-laminated, yellowish brown to gray, hard, well- indurated packstones composed of sand-sized chalk clasts and skeletal debris. Calcarenites contain to 35 percent quartz and are lacking in reservoir quality porosity. Conglomeratic Chalk Fades. Thin, conglomeratic chalks occur rarely within the chalk section. They are distinct from Pebble Floatstones in that they exhibit distinct conglomeratic texture that has resulted from the transport and deposition of previously lithified, granule- to pebble-sized lithoclastic materials.

The thin conglomeratic beds exhibit no internal structure, with clasts that are typically chaotic in their distribution. They are thought to represent hardgrounds. Conglomeratic chalks are volumetrically insignificant the chalk reservoir section; moreover, no reservoir quality porosity has been identified within the Conglomeratic chalk lithofacies. Deformed Chalk Facies. The Deformed chalk lithofacies is significant within the chalk section in terms of both its tectonic/sedimentologic as well as its volumetric importance within the chalk reservoir section. Deformed chalks are typically hard and well indurated. Bedding ranges from thin to thick, when recognized. Deformed chalks are typically composed of to percent quartz and less than percent clay minerals in the Tor and lower Ekofisk Formations. In the lower Ekofisk, quartz ranges from to 20 percent and the clay mineral content is in the range of to percent. The facies represents the gravitational resedimentation previously deposited materials and is defined by the weak to very strong deformation (contorted) of bedding or internal structures and internal fabric that characterized the pre-existing lithofacies. In our descriptions, the lithofacies undergoing deformation are identified when possible. Where identification of the fades that was deformed is uncertain, an effort is made to determine whether or not the deformed section is stratified. Calcareous Shale Fades. Calcareous shales range from various shades of gray to reddish brown in color and are typically fairly soft and poorly indurated. Bedding is usually thin to very thin, with beds commonly displaying discontinuous, wavy lamination and very rare burrowing. The facies is typically composed of very calcareous, siliciclastic clayshales and mudshales containing more than 40 percent quartz and more than 15 percent clay mineral material.

Woody (20-50%) inertinitic (10-20%) and degraded elements (10-50%) are approximately equally common. Palynofossils make up 15-60% of kerogens though significant proportion of these are reworked. Palynofossils: Dinoflagellates are mostly the dominant palynofossil (25-80% of palynofossils). Saccate pollen make up about10-50% and spores/non-saccate pollen 15-35%. Comments: units can be recognised. 1) The 1430-1450m section is no younger than Lower Pleistocene to Upper Pliocene on the basis of the occurrence of Filisphaerafilifera and F. filifera pilosa/subspp. (mostly dissoluble types). 2) Downhole from 1470m the record of Achomosphaera andalousiensis indicates penetration the lower part of the Upper Pliocene or older.

Specimens of Callialasporites spp., Cerebropollenites mesozoicus and other species suggest reworking of Middle to Upper Jurassic deposits. Dracodinium sp. at 1910m suggests Eocene or Oligocene reworking. There is also some intraformational reworking of Miocene, which confuses the palynostratigraphy (see comments to this section) Main kerogens & assemblage: Palynofossils are the dominant kerogen (60-90%). Degraded materials make up 5-20%, woody/cuticular 5-20% and inertinitic materials 5-15%. Palynofossils: Dinoflagellates (35-80%) and saccate pollen (10-65%) are the dominant palynofossil, usually in inverse proportions. Spores/non-saccate pollen make up 5-10, occasionally 15-20%. Comments 1730-1830m: Good Miocene markers are lacking in the upper part of this interval and the top of the Miocene cannot be reliably confirmed by the palynology. Tuberculodinium vancampoe occurs regularly from 1750m. This is not reliable marker but in this area seems to extend no higher than Lower Pliocene. Impagidinium granulatum is recorded at 1790m and Pentadinium laticinctum at 1810m (possibly at 1790m). The latter are probably of Upper Miocene age and may be in situ, but there are several records of Lower Miocene or older species which art out of sequence (Cordosphaeridium cantharellum at 1810-1830m and Homouyblium floripes at1830m). Some reworking of Miocene fossils has taken place, possibly within the Upper Miocene, reliable Miocene age is difficult to confirm above 1850m and the section can only be confidently assigned an Upper Miocene to Lower Pliocene age on the basis of the palynology. Comments 1850-1940m: From 1850m there is standard Upper Miocene succession. Hystrichosphaeropsis obscurum and Melitasphaeridium choanophorum both top at 1850m and are taken as indicating penetration of Upper Miocene (Tpl7b) or older deposits. There is an acme of Impagidinium granulatum at 1890m which probably represents correlatable event (also observed in 6406/2-2). Pentadinium laticinctum and Spiniferites pseudofurcatus both occur from 1910m and indicate penetration of the Upper Miocene zone Tpl7a or older.

Other planktonics are difficult to identify. No Bolboforma were observed. The presence of the planktonics and C. dutemplei suggest deep neritic or deeper conditions. The change to many more planktonics below 1720m (with burst) and the relatively thin Lower Pliocene - Upper Miocene suggest hiatus close to the Miocene - Pliocene boundary.

GEOLOGICAL SETTING (1:0 ;.,.,Eg -NTIER-ORUPPEN The Lower and Middle Triassic sequence at the Dia-Structure in the Barents Sea were drilled along seismic line on the northwestern side of the Dia- Structure in block 7323/7 (Figure and 2). total of nine cores, up to maximum of length, were recovered during period of 29 days in July 1986. Waterdepth was ca 420 and the bedrock was covered by ca 100 of Quaternary overburden. The average bedrock core recovery was 99.1%. Three sequence boundaries and six other reflectors, recognized on the seismic profile, were penetrated by the cores. In Figure the nine cores are plotted on the seismic record of sparker line D86-144B. Prominent reflectors and thicknesses of the various sequences are also indicated as well as dating of the sequence. The relative location of core D85-K, drilled in 1985, is also shown. A variety of analyses have been carried out (see Main Report: Vigran et al. 1987): detailed core description and sedimentological analyses, SEM- analysis, macro- and microfossil analysis, palynological analysis, extensive organic geochemical analysis, XRD-analysis, thin section analysis, natural y-radiation measurements and photographing of selected parts. The results are summarized for the individual cores below. 3.1 Facies interpretation The relative position of the different cores is schematicly indicated in Figure and facies relationships in Figure 3. Strata in Facies contain more than 50% sandstone. Strata in Facies II range from grey or bluish grey siltstone to claystone, with less than 50% sandstone. Strata in Facies III range from grey or bluish grey siltstone to silty claystone with graded siltstone laminae. Facies IV sediments are of dark silty shales with occasional greyish sandstone to clayey siltstone laminae interpreted as distal storm beds. Facies IV sediments are commonly very rich in fossil fragments, but there is little or no evidence of benthic activity, which suggest stratified water column with anoxoic to dysoxic bottom water overlain by oxygenated water. d alb] low2/AA4/r pp/O/ems/26-A PR-88', 'Passage_id': 972}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: N MD gorrrEF-aftupeuri -7- DRILLSITES WITH ESTIMATED DEPTH Figure Analog sparker line D86-1443.

Facies IA consists of fining upward turbidite sandstone with interbedded siltstones and shales. It is interpreted as trasgressive shallow shelf deposit strongly influenced by storms. The overlying Facies IIA consists of coarsening upward section of siltstone and silty shale interpreted as regressive shelf deposit, slightly influenced by storms. The core is organic-lean, and appears to be of low thermal maturity. Core 7323/7-U-6 (34.96 m) is diveded in Facies IIB, IIC and IIIA. Facies IIB consists of coarsening upward section of siltstone and silty claystone. Facies IIC overlies Facies IIB with sharp contact and has less frequent sandstone beds. Facies IIIA consists of siltstones and silty shales. Facies IIB is interpreted as regressive shelf depostit, overlain by transgressive deposits of Facies IIC, while Facies IIIA represent deep shelf. This arenaceous core is poor in organic matter. Core 7323/7-U-3 (33.23 m) is divided in Facies IID and IVA. The lower Facies IID consists of coarsening upward section of bioturbated sandy to clayey siltstone which is interperted as storm and current influenced shelf deposit. The overlying Facies IVA consists of dark grey silty shale with some graded sandstone laminae and dolomite beds. It is interpreted as deep, quiet anoxic shelf deposits. The lower zone below 107 is charcterised by generally fair organic richness of type III kerogen. The argillaceous zone above, is characterised by very good to excellent organic richness (average TOC = 3.6wt%) of immature type II/III kerogen. diafollow2/AA4/rapp/9/ems/26-APR-88\", 'Passage_id': 975}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -10- CIO_ ET iiINTER.ORUPPEN Core 7323/7-U-4 (43.47 m) is divided into Facies IVB and IVC.

The overlying Facies IVC has an abrupt boundary with the underlying unit. Facies IVC may represent slighty shallower shelf depoit than Facies IVB. This organic rich core has very good to excellent hydrocarbon generation potential. Core 7323/7-U-1 (33.15 m) is divided in Facies IIIB and IIE. The Lower Facies IIIB consists of dark grey bioturbated silty claystone with some grey graded siltstone and sandstone laminae. The fades is interpreted as deep dysoxic shelf deposit with slight storm influence. Facies IIE consists of bioturbated siltstone with common siderite-cemented, graded siltstone and sandstone beds and the facies is interpreted as slightly regressive, storm-influenced shelf deposits. The core is relatively rich in organic matter. Core 7223/7-U-7 (3.14 m) consists of bioturbated clayey to sandy siltstone with graded sandstone beds (Facies IIF). The core is intetpreted to be storm and current-influenced shelf deposit. This core is generally rich in organic matter. Core 7323/7-U-9 (29.23 m) is diveded in Facies IIG, IB and IVD. The lowermost Facies IIG consists of bioturbated clayey siltstone with graded sandstone beds, and it is interpreted as storm and current influenced shelf deposit. The abruptly overlying Facies IB consists of strongly bioturbated silty sandstone with primary bedding destroyed by intensive bioturbation. relative sea level fall to probably fairly shallow shelf deposits took place from Facies IIG to IB. The uppermost Facies IVD consists of dark grey silty shale with abundant phosphorite nodules. The lower are calcareous, bioturbated, and contain some sandstone beds. An important transgression took place from Facies IB to Facies IVD when anoxic deep shelf conditions were finally established. The core has high organic richness. Core 7323/7-U-5 (43.0 m) consists of coarsening upward section of sandy to clayey siltstone (Facies IIH) that is bioturbated, siderite cemented, and contains graded sandstone beds.

HACROPALEONTOLOGY AND BIOSTRATIGRAPHICAL ZONATION. _ CIN Eg iimmar-ootuppEr4 In the Arctic (Svalbard, Greenland, the Canadian Sverdrup Basin and Arctic USSR) there exist well documented Triassic succession and biostratigraphical zonation based on macrofossils. The present Arctic realm differs from the Thethys realm in beeing dominated by endemic faunas, and consequently the zonation scheme is of local significance. Ammonites have been the main tool for biostratigraphical zonation. The Standard for the Triassic time published by Tozer (1967) is based on the well documented Triassic sections of Canada, and of major importance are the British Columbia sections which provide link between the Thethys fauna and the Arctic Islands, The Triassic succession of Svalbard has been referred to the standard section of the Sverdrup Basin (Arctic Canada) by Tozer and Parker (1968), and further studies as well as comparizons with the Arctic USSR sections have been supplied for Svalbard by Korchinskaya (1982 and 1986). Recently Weitschat and Dagys have reviewed the biostratigraphical scheme (Figure and 5), and comments on this reviewed correlation scheme are given below. 4.1 Ammonoid correlation Scheme The correlation schemes (Figure and 5) compare faunas from Canada, Siberia and Svalbard and comments are given to the published major papers. 4.1.1 The Early Triassic Induan Recently Korchinskaya (1986) has published detailed scheme of the Induan from Svalbard which can be accepted with some comments. For the Griesbachian she postulated two zones (Otoceras boreale and Proptychites rosenkranizi). The zone of 0. boreale is the oldest unit of the Svalbard archipelago. Analogues of the 0. concavum zone of Canada is unknown. Moreover the ammonoid-fauna, Ophiceras spathi, and Wordieioceras oxynotus, which occur together with 0. boreale (appr. above the Permian/Triassic boundary) also indicate the upper part of the 0. boreale zone. diafollow2/AA4/rapp/12/ems/26-APR-88', 'Passage_id': 977}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -15- 4.1.2 The Middle Triassic Anisian (Ci0 ET PITER-GRUPPIEN The ammonoid zonation of the Anisian of Svalbard which was given by Tozer and Parker (1968) can still be generally accepted. Based on relatively sparse faunas they recognized, from different sections, three ammonoid- zones: Lenotropites caurus in the Early Anisian, Anagymnotoceras varium in the Middle Anisian and Frechiteslaqueatus in the Late Anisian. Due to further investigations by Korchinskaya (1982) and Weitschat (1986) we are able to give more detailed subdivision of the Anisian based on quite rich faunas. Early Anisian In the Early Anisian several ammonoid assemblages have been described, unfortunately all from different sections and areas. The lowest assemblage on Svalbard was collected by Weitschat from phosphatic nodular bed just above the Lower/Middle Triassic transition at Wallenbergfjellet (Central Spitsbergen) and contains Karangatites evolutus and Ussurites sp. Another assemblage was collected from Kongressfjellet approximately 25-30 above the Lower/Middle Triassic boundary and contains Lenotropites solitarius and Groenlandites sp. Two other assemblages were described by Korchinskaya from the eastern and northeastern parts of the archipelago. One is defined from Edgeoya and includes Lenotropites cf. caurus and L. tardus. The other was described from Wahlbergoya (Hinlopen Street) and contains quite rich fauna derived from phospatic nodules from the base of the Anisian sequence. It includes species of the genera Lenotropites, Grambergia, Pearylandites, Stenopopanoceras, Eodanubites, Leiophyllites and Japonites. While the three first mentioned faunas seems to be natural ones, the last is most probably condensed fauna. diafollow2/AA4/rapp/15/ems/26-APR-88', 'Passage_id': 978}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -17- -II Kg Arrar-canupeem A comparison with the detailed subdivision of the Siberian Lower Anisian (Dagys 1984) (Figure 5) explain the stratigraphical position of the different Svalbardian faunas. The beds with Karangatites evolutus correspond with the lowest unit of the boreal Anisian, the K. evolutus subzone (Grambergina tayimyrensis zone) of Siberia. The second assemblage is equivalent to the Lenotropites solitarius subzone and the third with the L. tardus zone s.str. from Siberia. The condensed beds from Wahlbergeya contain ammonoids from the L. mirabile subzone up to the L. caurus zone of Siberia. To be able to preserve the stability of zonal nomenclature we prefer to retain the L. caurus zone in wide sense which includes most of the Early Anisian except beds with Karangatites evolutus. Consequently the lowermost part of the Anisian of Spitsbergen may be separated as an independent K. evolutus zone. This subdivision corresponds quite well with the Siberian biotratigraphy. Middle Anisian From the Middle Anisian strata of Svalbard only one level with distinct ammonoid-fauna is at present found. This fauna is characterized by the dominance of two genera Anagymnotoceras and Amphipopanoceras. The fauna occurs in phosphatic limestone and can be traced nearly all over the archipelago. In some areas the ammonoids are extremely well preserved due to phosphatization (Weitschat 1986). Besides species of Anagymnotoceras (A. varium, A. cf. whrighti) and Amphipopanoceras (A. cf. medium) the fauna also contains Czekanowskites !wryest, Leiophyllites sp. and some species of the genus Hollandites (H. pelletieri and H. sp.). Korchinskaya (1982) described two species of Gymnotoceras (G. todimannae and G. geminatum) from Dickson Land and Gronfjorden, which are most probably young evolute variants of Anagymnotoceras and Hollandites. Only at one section (Stensiofjellet) second Middle Anisian ammonoid-level occurs 10 above the mentioned one (last year field work by Weitschat). This level contains Anagymnotoceras sp. nov. and Amphipopanoceras, but no specimens of Czekanowskites. diafollow2/AA4/rapp/17/ems/26-APR-88', 'Passage_id': 979}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -18- _ . (C) ..,.PU NTER-GRUPPEN Comparing the fossil record of the Middle Anisian of Svalbard with the Canadian and Siberian sequences, it seems that there exist until now no faunal proof of presence of the oldest part of the Middle Anisian (the Parapinacoceras haugei zone of Canada and the Cyakanowskites decipiens zone of Siberia). For exact correlation of the Svalbardian A. varium fauna we can compare with the distribution of Czekanowskites hayesi. In British Columbia this species occurs only in the middle part of the A. varium zone (C. hayesi subzone). In Siberia it is restricted to the lower part of the Arctohungarites kharaulakhensis zone (subzone of Arctohungarites laevigatus). Late Anisian In the Upper Anisian sequence of Svalbard until now only one level with distinct ammonoid fauna have been found, which occurs in layer of quite large calcareous nodules approximately 10 above the base of the Blanknuten Beds. The fauna is characterized by the first appearance of ptychitids. Contrary to Tozer's impression the fauna of this horizon is not rare on Spitsbergen, and has been recorded from various sections on Dickson Land (Central Spitsbergen) as well as from the east coast (Wiche Bukta) and from Edgeoya. Besides Aristoptychites trochleaeformis which dominates, the assemblage includes Parapopanoceras malmgreni, Frechites laqueatus, Ussurites sp. and Daonella lindstroemi (lamell.). Korchinskaya (1982) also mentioned species of Gymnotoceras from this level. They are poorly preserved and their determination are rather doubtful. Specimens of this genus are absent in the authors (W. Weitschat) collection, which contains some hundred specimens. Therefore Korchinskaya's correlation of this level with both the Late Anisian ammonoid-zones (Gymnotoceras rotelliformis and Frechites nevadanus) from Siberia may be questionable. Tozer & Parker (1968) considered that Frechiteslaqueatus closely resembles Frechites chischa and that therefore the F. laqueatus zone of Svalbard is equivalent to the F. chischa zone of Canada. The new discovery of Parafrechi (es d afollow2/AA4h app/ 8/em s/26-A PR-88\", 'Passage_id': 980}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -19- 5 ET ilINTEF-GRUPPEN miwyi from Wallenbergfjellet and Sticky Keep (Central-Spitsbergen) now allows more detailed correlation of this level. In Siberia this species is only known from the lower and middle part of the F.nevadwua zone (subzone of Amphipopanoceras dzeginense and Frechites nevadanus). For this reason we consider that the F. laqueatus zone of Spitsbergen is equivalent only to this part of the Siberian F. nevokmus zone and to the lower part of the F. chischa zone of Canada. Any faunal record of the lower part of the Late Anisian, the Gymnotoceras rotelliformis zone of Siberia and the G. deleeni zone of Canada, is lacking on the Svalbard archipelago at present. Ladinian The biostratigraphical subdivision of the Ladinian in the present Arctic province is quite confusing. Ammonoids from this time interval belong mainly to the endemic family Nathorstitidae which needs fundamental revision especially for the Siberian material. Tozer has revised the nathorstids from British Columbia where mixed fauna of boreal and thethyan ammonoids exist; unfortunately the results of this revisison are still unpublished. On Svalbard Tozer & Parker (1968) had distinguished two Ladinian zones. While they had left open the age of the lower one they had included in the Late Ladinian only the beds with Daxatina canadensis on Bjornoya. In British Columbia this species is restricted to the highest Ladinian strata (the upper part of the Frankites sutherlandi zone). The first doubtless Early Ladinian ammonoid-fauna was described by Weitschat & Lehmann (1983); it contains Aristoptychites euglyphus, 'Tsvetkovites' varius, Ussurites sp. and the bivalve Daonella lindstroemi. A. euglyphus which is the most common fossil in this level closely resembles Arctoptychitesomo/ojensis from the Early Ladinian of Siberia. In Korchinskaya's zonal scheme the Lower Ladinian was included in the nanuk zone, together with Ptychites nattuk, Ussurites spitzbergensis and Daonella degeeri. This level is however clearly younger and probably belongs to the Late Ladinian. The Late Ladinian of Svalbard include the lndigirites tozeri zone which was established by Weitschat & Lehmann (1983) for their Upper Ptychitid-layer near the top of the Blanknuten Beds. Indigirites tozeri is highly variable species and includes specimens which in Siberia are usually interpreted as Nathorstites macconelli or N. lenticularis. tlialollow2/AA4/rapp/19/ems/26-APR-88\", 'Passage_id': 981}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -20- iCIN Mg aINTIEF-ORUPPIEN Two levels with ammonoids may be correlated to this Nathorstites fauna. lower one wi th Aristoptychites kolymensis, Indigirites tozeri, Ussurites spitzbergensis, Proarcestes sp. and the bivalve Daonella degeeri and an upper one with Indigirites tozeri, Ussurnes spitzbergensis, crushed specimens of Trachyceratidae and the bivalve Daonella aff. subarctica. Consequently the I. tozeri zone is equivalent of Korchinskaya's two Ladinian zones' (Ptychites nanuk and of Nathorstites tnacconelli). Ptychites nanuk keeps within the limits of Aristoptychites kolymensis and is considered as synonym of this species. Korchinskaya's Nathorstites macconelli is rather comparable with thick variants of Indigirites tozeri and is clearly not co-specific with the real N. macconelli from British Columbia. Quite similar forms of I. tozeri occur in the zone of Meginoceras meginae in British Columbia. Equivalents of the uppermost Ladinian beds on Svalbard are known until now only from the Daxatinacanadensis beds of Bjerneya and from one single badly preserved specimen of Daxatina sp. from Barentsoya (Middendorf-Berget). As cited above this species is restricted to the highest Upper Ladinian beds in British Columbia. Karni an The characteristic lithological change between the Sassendalen and the Kapp Toscana Groups is probably identical with the Ladinian/Karnian boundary. At Roslagenfjellet and Wiche Bukta (East coast) there occur only - above the group boundary quite rich fauna with Nathorstites tenuis, Discophyllites cf. taimyrensis, Nathorstites spenov., Paracladiscites cf. diutumus and the bivalve Halobia zitteli. The Nathorstites fauna had been object of long discussions, whether they are of Ladinian of Karnian age. At least the Nathorstites fauna described by Stolley (1911) is considered as Early Karnian. All the Karnian specimens have distinguished features which separate them from the Ladinian forms so that the proposition of Archipov (1974) to establish new genus (Sroileires) for this group seems acceptable. The Svalbardian Stolleites tenuis zone can be corrrelated quite good with Siberia, where S. tenuis is common in the Early Karnian strata (Bychkov 1982). dittfollow2/AA4/rapp/20/ems/26-APR-88\", 'Passage_id': 982}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -21- 4.2 Macrofossils from the Dia-structure cores. Preservation of fossils -ORUPIPEN The major problems when studying macrofossils in cores are that most often only fragments of the fossils are recorded. In the present cores most of the material also were highly compacted; and only few specimen were uncompacted. This will of course influence the precision during determination, and identification to species level are exceptional. Macrofossil content The occurences of macrofossils are shown in Figure 6. Core 7323/7-U-8: The faunal assemblage indicates clearly Smithian age. Ammonites of the family prionitidae are restricted to the zone of Wasaidlites tan*a. similar fauna was described from Spitsbergen by Weitschat and Lehmann (1978). Posidoniamimer indicates general Smithian age. Core 7323/7-U-6: The sparse bivalve assemblage indicates Late Smithian age. Core 7323/7-U-3: The fauna includes few indeterminable bivalves,and is very sparse. One ammonite at may represent ?Pseudosageceratidae. The core may, from the sparse fossil information be of Smithian throughout Spathian age. The absence of the bivalve Posidoniamimer may, however, indicate that the Smithian layers in the core below have been left, and indirectly thereby indicate that the core represents the Spathian. Core 7323/7-11-4: rich fauna has been recorded. Below 100 the presence of Keyserlingites sp. indicates that the uppermost Keyserlingites subrobutus zone of the Early Triassic has been reached. Posidoniaaranea is typical for the uppermost Spathian faunas all over the Arctic as well as in British Columbia. In the upper part of the core, the presence of Grambergkt and Lenotropites show that the ammonite zone of the Early Anisian, the Lenotropites mums zone, has been penetrated. The fossil evidences thus indicate that the Spathian - Anisian boundary was penetrated by this core. diarollow2/AAVrapp/21/ems/26-APR-88', 'Passage_id': 983}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -22- ,_ 10 ...,.Eg _..NTIMP.ORUPPIEN Core 7323/7-U-1: In this core no well preserved bivalves were recorded, however the abundant ammonite fauna with Anagymnotoceras and Amphipopanoceras both indicate Middle Anisian.

Core 7323/7-U-9: rich ammonite and bivalve fauna was recorded.

PALTNOLOGY The results of the palynological investigation of the nine cores are condenced to two vertical distribution charts (Figure and 8) listing selected palynomorphs with common presence within the assemblages, with regional stratigraphical value or considered of local stratigraphic potential. The total stratigraphic ranges for some of the palynomorphs may still be incompletely known as some of the fossils may possibly have different appearances in the Barents Sea than in the more southerly European provinces. Therefore, the Triassic zonation is consequently based on the material from the Dia-structure and have local value, however, it also surves as basis for further palynological correlation within the Barents Sea area. The correlations of the material from the Dia-Structure is based on the well documented publications from the Alpine area of van der Eem (1983) and Brugman (1986). Taxa names on Figure and in some cases have been revised for which reason we refer to the plate explanation. 5.1 Climatic and environment indicators Visscher & van der Zwan (1984) distinguished floral provinces in the Triassic (Ladinian to Karnian) on the basis of palynological assemblage composition. Palynomorphs are grouped according to the climatic zones of Robinson (1973), as hygrophytic, xerophytic and indifferent forms. Briefly both northern (Laurasian) and southern (Gondwanaland) domains are characterized by hygrophytic floras as indicated by abundant pteridophyte spores, the cycadophytic pollen, and gymnospermous taxa. The northern area with Ovalipollispseudoalatus, is distinguished from the southern area with Samaropollenites speciosus and both are devided by broad xerophytic Tethyan equatorial belt with transitional, however, xerophytic floras.', 'Passage_id': 985}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -.27- _ (10 ET iNNTUPLORUPPIEN The Barents Sea Dia-Structure asemblages have in general hygrophytic aspect containing abundant Cycadopites spp., Arearisporita spp. and variable trilete spores (smooth, ornamented, cingulate and zonotrilete forms). The same taxa are also recorded in Karnian assemblages from Poland, Austria and Germany (Visscher & van der Zwan 1984) and are in general characteristic for assemblages from the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (Fisher 1979). Taeniate pollen and Triadispora spp. representing more xerophytic plants (Visscher & van der Zwan 1984) are numerous at intervals. Therefore it is thought that the assemblages from the Barents Sea reflect flora growing under humid conditions close to the basin, with an input of species reflecting more xerophytic conditions from the hinterland. The relative composition of the assemblages seems to reflect transport and sorting mechanisms rather than change in humidity during the Middle Triassic of the area. This is supported by the variable richness and composition of the microplankton assemblages. Well preserved terrestrial palynomorphs and cuticles from leaves in some cores are recorded in sediments where the lithology reflects deep shelf depositonal environment. Storm generated turbidities may have transported these assemblages to the depositional locality (U-8 and U-6). Moreover, assemblages from marine sediments deposited at considerable distance from the paleoshoreline do contain more abundant to even dominant bisaccates, due to better floating ability. 5.2 Stratigraphic palynology The vertical range charts for the individual cores (in the main data report) have been revised to interpreted total range charts: Figure has been based on the first appearances of the more characteristic and the suggested stratigraphic important taxa recorded in the cores. Figure has been based on the last occurrences (extinction, top downhole) records of the same taxa. 5.2.1 The Early Triassic The Late Smithian Wasachitestardus zone is recognized within the succession of the cores U-8, U-6 and U-3, the latter also covers the earliest Spathian deposits. Core U-4 is situated at the Spathian to Anisian transition, as interpreted from the macrofaunal records. diafollow2/AA4/rapp/27/ems/26-APR-88', 'Passage_id': 986}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -28- N :ET SIPITUP-GRILIIIPPEN The Early Triassic palynomorph assemblages recovered from the stratigraphic succession of cores U-8, U-6 and U-3, may be seen as reflecting the gradual changes of the depositional environments. On the other hand the palynomorphs also reflect the development and evolution of the floras growing around the depositonal basin, changing gradually in response to outer factors to an optimum vegetation. The local stratigraphic key species for zonation may often be sourced from sites that are affected by minor sea level changes, while the vegetation of the elevated or hinterland localities provides forms recorded through longer time intervals occurring as background. The low frequences of taxa in the assemblages of core U-6 may be mainly ascribed to local deposition control, although it may reflect more widely recognized sea level changes. Core 7323/7-U-8: The ammonites in this core, assigned to Arctoprionitesnodosus and the Prionitidae, are appearing together with the bivalve Posidoniarnimer, lingulid brachiopods and fish fragments. They support the marine shelf environment, as indicated by the sedimentology. The palynological residues from the fairly coarse deposits comprise of poorly sorted assemblages of cuticular fragments of variably thickness and variably preserved groups of isodiametric cells as well as tracheidal cells from woody tissues. Megaspores are very common at intervals and reflect the variable grain size of the sediment. The fairly rich, varied and well preserved palynomorph assemblages mostly allow recognition of more than 15 taxa, at some levels 20-40 taxa per sample. Acritarchs are present throughout, but only Veryhachium is abundant (above 123 m) and support marine environment of deposition into which the plant debris may have been carried as bedload. The conditions were interpreted from sedimentological data as consistant with quiet, outer deltaic setting in balance with rising sea level. The palynomorph assemblages are characterized by variably thickwalled, large as well as small spores. Characteristic forms include taxa like Punctatisportes fungosus and Lapposisporites lapposus.

Core 7323/7-U-6: The ammonites of this core are poorly represented in the bioturbated mostly clayey siltstones. The equivalent of the Wasatddreskralta zone was evaluated on the basis of the bivalves Pseudomonites occidentalis and Posidonia mimer both of which are known from the lithologically equivalent deposits of the succession in Svalbard. The assemblages, although they are as poorly sorted as in core U-8, are certainly less varied and with majority of smaller spores. Acritarchs are more common than in the core below. The number of recorded forms in any of the assemblages only rarely exceeds 10-15 taxa. Characteristic features in the assemblages of core U-6 are also the numerous Punctatisporitesfungosus. The abundance of Cyccdopita pollen and the relative increase in importance of Densoisporitesplayfordii in relation to D. nejburgii distinguish the assemblages from U-B.

Acritarchs (Micrhystridium spp. and Veryhachium spp.) are common throughout. An outer deltaic type of environment as for core U-8 was suggested by the data report. According to the sedimentological studies transition is seen from shallowing prograding to shelf deposits through transgression with gradually increased water depths and less storm influence. dialollow2/AA4/rapp/29/ems/26-APR-88\", 'Passage_id': 988}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -30- N_ ET iierrar-oftuppuspd Core 7323/7-U-3: The sparse faunal evidence (one ammonite, indeterminate bivalves, fish fragments, cephalopod hooks) recorded in this core suggests an indeterminate late Early Triassic age for the deposits. The apparent absence of Posidoniamimer is recognized as feature of the uppermost Early Triassic (Spathian) in Spitsbergen. Sandy to clayey siltstones dominate in the lower coarsening upward sequence and the palynomorphs assemblages resemble those of the stratigraphically lower cores, but are distinguished from core U-6 by the reappearence of many taxa from core U-8 and by the stronger influx of bisaccoid pollen. Of particular note is the strong influx of Wrkymidium spp. and the abundant and fairly well preserved Tasmanites spp., which represents the plankton of the marine surface water. The abundant bisaccates support transport and sorting of terrestrial debris further away from the land areas and deposition in low energy water. The preservation of bacterial (algal) degradation products is evidence supporting quiet stagnant water conditions. The deposits, organic rich dark shales, from above 107 depth of core U-3 reflect rapid transgressive event resulting in an environmental change into deep quiet shelf with anoxic conditions. Bisaccoid pollen are well represented by Lunatisporitesnoviaukwis,Lacutta and Triadispon2crassa. Spores represent varied assemblage, but are recorded in lower numbers. The lower part of core U-3 contains rich palynomorph assemblages and number of taxa present in the stratigraphically underlying cores were recorded only in deposits below meters: Reticulatisporites bunteri, Punctatisporites fungosus, Lapposisporites lapposus, Alisporites spp. , Lundbladispora obsoleta, Densoisporites playfordii, Lundbladispora spp. , Kraeuselisporites wargalensis and Verrucosisporites cf. remyanus. The absence or low records above meters of many taxa are due to environmental control through sedimentation and preservation. The residues of these sediments are generally dominated by debris, particularly algal degradation products (Tastnanites). From palynological point of view transition from the Smithian to the Spathian possible takes place at meters. diafollow2/AA4/rapp/30/ems/26-APR-88', 'Passage_id': 989}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7323/7-U-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -31- 5.2.2 The Early to Middle Triassic transition (1E, - _INTRF-ORUPPEN Core 7323/7-U-4 spans the Early to Middle Triassic transition. The presence of the ammonoids Keyserlingites sp. and Svalbardiceras sp. from 138.62m to 102.39m below the sea floor indicates the uppermost Spathian Keysedingitessubrobustus zone for the lowest part of this core. The bivalve Posidoniaaranea (observed throughout the Arctic) is typical in uppermost Spathian faunas. The deposits upwards as from meters contain Grambergia sp. and Lenotropites sp. indicate the Lower Anisian Lenotropites zone. Troughout the core silty shales with calcite, phosphorite and dolomite nodules are interpreted to be formed in deep anoxic outer shelf environment with some storm influence. This environmental interpretation is supported by the abundance of Tasmanites and the variably rich acritarch assemblages. Tasmanhes cells are particularly well preserved towards the top of core U-4. The palynomorph assemblages of the uppermost part of the core are richer and better preserved than the lower ones and the reappearances and the abundance of number of taxa may be ascribed to changes in the depositional environment, and Anisian age is suggested from the palynoassemblages from and above.

Triadispora spp. seem well established and varied, and spores are abundant. Deposits with low organic content (120.01 to 124.01m), show variable input of acritarchs and relatively low input of Tasmanites. The assemblages are very rich in Aratrisporites spp. and contain the same spores as recorded in the underlying interval.

Above meters the rich and varied palynomorph assemblages are characterized particularly by the variety of the spores, including the Raistrickia group. Vetyhachium is well represented, although the organic poor deposits have reduced variety of acritarchs. Core 7323/7-U-7: The ammonite evidence in the short core U-7 indicates the Late Anisian Frechiteslaqueatus zone. The palynomorphs cannot at present be differentiated from those of core U-1, because the assemblages are more or less of the same composition and indicate general Anisian age. Raistrickia sp. and R. sp. B, however, seems to be more rare. These forms may be used as typical indicators of the Anisian in the Barents Sea, but their presence in the assemblages will certainly be under enviromental control. Ladinian The faunal evidence for the Ladinian is less firm than for the Anisian. The bioturbated clayey siltstones and sandstone with phosphorite and calcite nodules in core U-9 contain fauna with Daonellalindstroemi and show close resemblance with the lower ptychitid nodule layers of the Daonella shales of the Botneheia Member on Svalbard. The bioturbated siderite cemented sandy to clayey siltstones of core U-5, and the bioturbated clayey siltstones with phosphorite nodules in core U-2 do not contain any faunal evidence for dating of the deposits.

For example, the black solid line in Figure is one to one plot of reservoir pressure (ie: reservoir pressure = reservoir pressure). This defines the upper boundary of the failure window. Following the UCS line from the X-axis to the reservoir pressure depletion line, the difference between the one to one reservoir line and the UCS failure line is the drawdown which can be applied without inducing failure. Usually when the reservoir is at virgin pressure, the formation can withstand large drawdown without suffering failure. This is because the reservoir pressure supports some portion of the overburden stress, minimizing the load that must be supported by the rock matrix. As reservoir pressure depletes and the effective overburden stress becomes larger and larger, the reservoir rock can handle less and less drawdown before failure occurs. At some point (where the lines meet) the formation cannot withstand any drawdown without failure. The triangle made be the X-axis the UCS failure line, and the unit slope reservoir pressure line (shaded area of Figure & 3.3) defines the failure window or area where formation failure (and sand production) is expected.  Figure and follows the same general pattern as Figure 3.1, however additional rock strength and K,-factor lines have been incorporated into the plot to show sensitivities to strength and stress state variations. Simulation runs made assuming that the grid blocks around the perforation were damaged at K, =0.1K, (Kda = 45 md) indicate that high drawdowns will cause some friction related tensile effects. Drawdown effects therefore can not be considered negligible. Formation Failure Summary for Horizontal Openhole Completions Summarizing from Figures & and Table identifies formation failure concerns for a horizontal openhole completion in the Heimdal sandstone. Horizontal openhole cases were simulated in the event that horizontal well development is undertaken. In Figure note that 80 psi UCS rock for all values of K,, as shown by the yellow dot, coincides with the initial reservoir conditions of 2950 psi. This indicates that at initial conditions, all rock within the perforated interval with UCS less than 80 psi should fail. Converting this simulation result to meters of failed interval above the OWC, represents failed out of the 18 total or 16%. Continuing, 278 psi UCS rock is expected to begin entering the failure region as function of both the reservoir pressure and the amount of drawdown imposed on the well. For example, look at the green line in Figure 3.2. At reservoir pressure of 2050 psi for K,= and no drawdown, the well will enter the failure window. Or at 2950 psi reservoir pressure and drawdown exceeding 1850 psi, the well will enter the failure window. Therefore before the reservoir pressure depletes to 2050 psi the formation could fail depending on the drawdown. But after the reservoir depletes to below 2050 psi, then all of sections of the producing interval with UCS less than 278 psi will fail. Depending on the reservoir pressure if it is above 2050 psi and the amount of drawdown, as much as 10 of the 18 or 56% of producing interval could fail. As noted above, K, =.665 represents the low end of the most probable range for K, values and has therefore been used as basis for worst case predictions. For the more probable prediction (K,=.813) look at the red line in Figure 3.2. At 1850 psi reservoir pressure, regardless of the drawdown, all of the producing interval with UCS less than 278 psi will fail. Page 12', 'Passage_id': 993}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/7-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: However before the reservoir depletes to 1850 psi, the formation will fail based on the reservoir pressure and the drawdown placed on the formation. For example at initial reservoir pressure and drawdown greater than 2400 psi, 278 psi UCS formation will fail. ( See Figure 3.1 for an example and Figure for all cases) So again, depending on the reservoir pressure above 1850 psi and the amount of drawdown, as much as 10 of the 18 or 56% of producing interval could fail. Alternatively, stronger, 1300 psi UCS rock should enter the failure window at much lower, 1450 psi, reservoir pressure with zero drawdown for the same K, = 0.665. From this we can estimate that 25 of the 29 samples tested above the OWC in the formation strength measurement portion of this study (86%) will fail. Or in terms of meters of producing interval above the OWC, 14 of the 18 will fail. Similarly for the more-probable K, value (K, = 0.813) and zero drawdown, 1300 psi UCS rock would be expected to enter the failure window at reservoir pressure of 1200 psi and could enter the failure window at reservoir pressure of 2100 psi if 2100 psi drawdown was imposed on the well. Therefore between 2100 psi and 1200 psi reservoir pressure, entering the formation failure window is function of the degree of drawdown imposed on the well. From this we can estimate that 25 of the 29 samples tested above the OWC in the formation strength measurement portion of this study (86%) will fail. Or in terms of meters of producing interval above the OWC, 14 of the 18 will fail if the reservoir pressure drops below 1200 psi and 86% of the producing interval could fail depending on the drawdown imposed on the well between 2100 and 1200 psi reservoir pressure. Most importantly though as noted initially, at all values of K, , the weakest measured UCS sections of the Heimdal sandstone producing interval where UCS is less than 80 psi, will enter the formation failure window immediately regardless of the drawdown or K, value. Therefore a sand control strategy/completion should be developed for any openhole horizontal well drilled in the Heimdal sandstone. Vertical Perforated Completions In addition to openhole horizontal completion simulations, set of formation failure simulation runs were also completed for vertical perforated wells. The results of these simulations are summarized in Table and Figures & of Appendix 3. Figure provides an example of one formation failure curve. In Figure the shaded area represents the formation failure window for 278 psi UCS rock with K, value equal to 0.813. Different from the horizontal openhole completions, the vertical perforated completion formation failure simulations indicate drawdown effects are not as prominent. However as in the horizontal openhole case, Figure shows that in vertical perforated wells 80 psi UCS rock for all values of K,, coincides with the initial reservoir conditions of 2950 psi. This indicates that at initial conditions with any amount of drawdown, all rock within the perforated interval with UCS less than 80 psi should fail. Converting to meters of interval above the OWC, represents failed out of the 18 total or 16%.

For example, look at the green line (K, = 0.665) in Figure 3.4. At reservoir pressure of 1800 psi and no drawdown the well will enter the failure window. Or as early as 2100 psi reservoir pressure and 2100 psi drawdown, the well will enter the failure window. Therefore before the reservoir pressure depletes to 1800 psi, the formation could fail depending on the drawdown. But after the reservoir depletes to below 1800 psi, then all of sections of the producing interval with UCS less than 278 psi will fail. Therefore depending on the reservoir pressure above 1800 psi and the amount of drawdown, as much as 10 of the 18 or 56% of producing interval could fail. As noted above, K, = represents the low end of the probable range for K, values and has been used as basis for worst case predictions. For the more probable prediction (K,= .813) look at the red line in Figure 3.4. At 1700 psi reservoir pressure, regardless of the drawdown, all of the producing interval with UCS less than 278 psi will fail. However before the reservoir depletes to 1700 psi, the formation will fail based on the reservoir pressure and the drawdown placed on the formation. For example at 2000 psi and 2000 psi drawdown the formation will fail. So again, depending on the reservoir pressure above 1700 psi and the amount of drawdown, as much as 10 of the 18 or 56% of producing interval could fail. The stronger 1300 psi UCS rock however, should enter the failure window at 1000 psi reservoir pressure with no drawdown for the same K, = 0.665. From this we can estimate that 25 of the 29 samples tested above the OWC in the formation strength measurement portion of this study (86%) will fail. Or in terms of meters of producing interval above the OWC, 14 m of the 18 (78%) will fail. Another important factor to notice in Figure is that for 1300 psi UCS rock, the drawdown has negligible effect of the formation failure. Therefore if the formation has UCS greater than or equal to 1300 psi then the drawdown effects can be considered negligible. Similarly for the more-probable K, value (K,= 0.813) and zero drawdown imposed on the formation, 1300 psi UCS rock would be expected to enter the failure window at reservoir pressure of 650 psi. Again from the original UCS characterization, 25 of the 29 samples (86%) that were tested from above the OWC should be assumed to fail. Or in terms of meters of producing interval above the OWC, 14 of the 18 (78%) will fail if the reservoir pressure drops below 650 psi. Again as noted by formation failure simulations for the openhole horizontal completions, at all values of K, factor, the sections of the Heimdal sandstone producing interval where UCS is less than 80 psi, will enter the formation failure window immediately regardless of the drawdown imposed or K, value. Therefore sand control strategy/completion should be developed for vertical perforated completions in the Heimdal sandstone.

An uncertainty analysis was performed on the Heimdal reservoir simulation results to help quantify the effect of input data uncertainties on model prediction results. Based on this and other similar analyses, the three variables that have the most effect on simulation results are formation strengths (UCS values), representative stress-strain data and in-situ stresses. For this reason range of rock strengths and factors have been run during the simulation process. As noted in the section above, the four sets of constitutive equations and two different Kifactors have been used to describe the range of rock strengths and formation stresses in the Heimdal. The range of prediction results are discussed in the section above and are summarized in Appendix 3. History matches conducted in other fields have shown that model prediction uncertainty is approximately + /-10% of the original reservoir pressure for typical North Sea work. This 10% uncertainty rule-of-thumb is closely approximated by the range of model prediction results for a 278 psi UCS rock. For this 278 psi UCS reference rock, the difference between predicted flowing bottomhole failure pressures (PF,H) range from 2050 psi at K, = to 1850 psi at K=0.813, roughly +/- 200 psi between the predictions. This 200 psi range closely approximates +/-10% of the initial Heimdal reservoir pressure of 2950 psi. As result, the area in between the various K, curves can be considered reasonable approximation for the range of possible failure pressures for the Heimdal sandstone. More accurate model predictions can be achieved through history matching the prediction results with real field data. This usually is in the form of reservoir pressures and dates where a sanding incident has been recorded, or reservoir condition where no sand event has been recorded. Easily documented events include DST's, separator cleanout records, piping and erosional records, individual well tests, and shut-downs. We strongly recommend that part of the sand control strategy include documenting sand and no sand events during the development drilling in order to history match the model formation failure predictions. This is really the only way to determine if triaxial data, both analog and reservoir specific, is representative of the formation failure phenomenon. Furthermore, the model does not predict the quantity of sand produced or the point when sand reaches the surface. Rather the model predicts the point at which first failure occurs. Failure is defined as reservoir condition at which the formation begins to crack, disintegrate and become susceptible to sand production. This does not imply that sand production at the surface will be noticed, rather that the formation has reached condition where any sudden changes in pressure (choke changes, pressure upsets, or rate increases) can cause the formation to release the failed interval into the flow stream. Then, if the flow rate is high enough to lift the sand out of the well, sand should be seen in the surface equipment. Some quantitative information can, however, be inferred from model results by correlating the length of failed interval with cumulative sand production measurements. This technique can provide guidance as to potential sand production rates but has high degree of uncertainty. Page 15\", 'Passage_id': 996}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/7-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Similar qualitative estimates can be obtained from intrusive or acoustic sand probes, however, these methods also have high degree of uncertainty. As result, review of pipe erosion trends is considered the best, least uncertain, method for estimating sand production rates. It is important to note that short intervals can produce large volumes of sand. This is shown in Figure of Appendix 3. As result it is considered prudent to develop sand control strategy prior to the formation of interest entering the failure window.

Very fine to very coarse grained sandstones are recorded at and below the ditch cuttings at 1570m. Glauconite is commonly recorded throughout the interval. According to the wireline log tops supplied, the interval 1470m-1550m is in the Brygge Formation (Hordeland Group) whereas the interval 1550m-1840m belongs to the Rogaland Group; no wireline log top for the Tang Formation was available. SHETLAND GROUP: 1840m(log)-2507m(log); Age: 'latest' - ?late Maastrichtian to Lithological evidence for the penetration of the Shetland Group, notably the occurrence of fine grained sediments and calcareous mudstones, first occurs in the ditch cuttings at 1863m and 1878m respectively. The lithology of the unit consists predominantly of medium dark grey, locally silty, variably calcareous mudstones and subordinate very fine to very coarse grained sandstones. According to the wireline log tops provided, this unit includes 25m thick sandstone (2282m[log]-2307m[log]) designated as the 'Imre Nise Sandstone'; on biostratigraphic evidence, the age of this unit is early Campanian.

Lange Formation 2544m(log)-3121m; Age: Coniacian to middle Cenomanian A downhole influx of very fine to coarse grained sandstones in the ditch cuttings at 2545m is, according to the wireline log information received, attributable to cavings from the overlying Lysing Formation. The Lange Formation is first seen in the ditch cuttings on downhole influx of medium dark grey, non-calcareous mudstones which are also present in small quantities in the ditch cuttings at and below 2830m. Very fine to very coarse grained sandstones occur irregularly throughout the sequence; they are particularly well represented in ditch cuttings from 2635m to 2650m and 2905m to 3013m. Ditch cuttings from 3022m to 3121m are heavily caved (particularly from 3022m to 3058m) making the lithological interpretation of this interval difficult; however, no evidence was recorded for the penetration of sediments older than the Lane Formation.\", 'Passage_id': 1003}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 6610/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Statoil a.s.

Recovery/Sample quality: Variable recovery, moderately good at 555m(SWC) but barren at 560m(SWC). Preservation: Good; diatoms recovered are pyritised. Faunal characteristics: The foraminifer& association at 555m(SWC) is composed eiclusively of small calcareous benthonic foraminifera. distinctive suite of diatoms is also present at this depth as well as shell debris, echinoderm fragments and pyritised sponge spicules. 555m(SWC) the presence of Turrilina alsatica (indicating an age no older than the Late Eocene) and Gyroidina soldanll girardana within distinctive association of calcareous benthonic foraminifers and first downhole appearance of Diatom sp. 54 RR1; 555m(SWC) the occurrence of Alabamina tangeMialis, Globocassidullna subglobosa, Ceratobulimina contraria, Cibicides aff. tenellus, Eponides pygmeus and Hoeglundina elegans together with occasional Nodosaria spinescens, Cibicides/Heterolepa and Stilostomella species. Micropalaeontological Comments: Turrilina alsatica, recorded here from 555m(SWC), is generally characteristic of assemblages of the Oligocene benthonic Zones MO(B)3-MO(B)1. review of the genus 71iffilina by Revets (1987) indicates, however, that this species ranges into the Late Eocene, and therefore its occurrence does not conflict with the palynological evidence; its presence at 555m(SWC) indicates an age no older than the Late Eocene. The diatoms recorded from this sample would also favour general Oligocene age by comparison with the North Sea; however, the Oligocene-restricted Diatom sp. King, 1983 was not found in this sample. Recovery/Sample quality: Good; assemblage slightly modified by reworking. Kerogen: Abundant woody debris, moderately degraded. Numerous plant cuticles.

(P) the appearance of common Systematophora placacantha indicating Middle Eocene, Subzone PE3C, age, whereas the appearance of Diphyes colligerum in the same sample indicates an age no younger than the Middle Eocene Subzone PE3D. STRATIGRAPHIC COMMENTS The palynolofloras from this interval are entirely consistent with an Eocene age, whereas the consistent presence of number of index microplankton taxa further restricts this age to the Middle Eocene. The diatom association recorded from the 585.8m(SWC) would, according to regional information, favour an Early Oligocene age. However, the lack of independently dated Eocene to Oligocene reference sections with comparable diatom associations makes their evidence for an Early Oligocene age inconclusive; it is possible that, at least in this area, these associations range into the Eocene. This possibility is supported by the absence of any Oligocene palynomorphs either from this sample or from those in the overlying intervals.

The recovery of microfossils exhibiting two different types of preservation within this interval suggests the possibility of very thin unit of glauconitic sediment of 'latest' Maastrichtian age resting upon older late Maastrichtian deposits or minor reworking of Zone MUK2 microfossils within slightly thicker sequence of MUK1 age.

STRATIGRAPHIC COMMENTS Both top and base of this interval have been established on palynological evidence. Location of the top Turonian in this well is hampered by the persistent occurrence of reworked Turonian-Cenomanian palynomorphs in the succession. The top of this interval is placed at depth below the basal occurrence of Coniacian microplankton associations. The Cenomanian indices which occur at several depths within this interval have been interpreted as reworked in view of their inconsistent distribution, the associated presence of reworked Lower Cretaceous taxa, and the widespread regional occurrence of Cenomanian reworking within Turonian deposits. The occurrence of common amorphous organic matter together with distinct microplanlcton assemblage characterised by common to abundant 'peridinioid cysts indeterminate' towards the base of this interval is taken as marking basal Turonian succession of regional correlatable value, and has been employed as guidance for location of the Turonian/Cenomanian boundary in this section. Interpretation of the palaeoenvironment is hampered by caving of foraminifera from the Maastrichtian. An outer shelf to upper bathyal environment of deposition is proposed from the consistent occurrence of rare calcareous benthonic and planktonic foraminifera which are considered to be in situ. Recovery/Sample quality: Generally poor and sporadic recovery. In situ microfaunas masked by cavings. Preservation: Moderate to poor, becoming poorer downhole. Faunal characteristics: In situ foraminifera are sparse and obscured by cavings. Below 2710m, rare specimens of the planktonic Redbergella spp. as well as agglutinated and calcareous benthonics are present, but the in situ nature of these forms is difficult to establish. localised influx of lnoceramus debris is noted towards the base of the interval.

Some samples from the deepest part of the well have also been prepared and analysed (2720- 3521m).

The other possibility is that the Tang is se- verely disturbed by cavings from the Tare and that the enigmatic observations at 1730m repre- sents Tang Fm. with reworking from the Creta- ceous. The break between the Tare and the Tang in this case may then be of mill years (55.8  58.8my). Finally, the high proportion of brackish/lacus- trine Botryococcus spp. within this interval should be considered. This is unusual in the Tang and Tare fins. and indicate specialized depositional environment. (58.8 - ?60.0 my) ZONE: TP5A (?TP3A2) UNIT: Tare with reworking, or Tang with caving and reworking. TAI: Mixed, all categories 1750, This productive and problematic interval is characterized by dominance in the same imma- ture palynomorphs and kerogens as observed in the interval above. Another important aspect is the common presence of upper Cretaceous and upper Paleocene (Tang Fm.) palynomorphs throughout this interval, and especially at 1730 and 1735m. These observations have earlier been taken to represent the penetration of the Upper Cretaceous, but their mixed composition would rather indicate that they are reworked. Another important observations is that the new and mixed Cretaceous and Paleocene assemblages represent all TAI levels, though with dominance of the im- mature to mature values, and few representing very mature and extremely mature levels. The Cretaceous forms represented are ranging from immature to (very) mature, indicating re- working from source beds that have experienced different temperature exposure. The very few forms that may be derived form the Tang Fm. are moderately mature to mature. The Tare Fm. palynomorphs (caved or in situ?) are immature. Because the Tare Fm. materials are found caved in abundance in the Shetland Group below, they may be taken as caved also in this interval, leaving us with very few and confusing observa- tion to base the interpretation on. One may rely on the observation of few mature examples of Isabelidinium viborgense from 1730m and below which is key fossil to the lower part of the Up- per Paleocene (zone TP3A2). We have, however, put weight to the record of a few mature to moderately mature examples of Apectodinium august= in this interval, among the dominating immature specimens of the same. These forms are not seen in the interval above, and they may be taken to be reworked together with the rest of the mixed Cretaceous-Paleocene assemblage. If so, with in situ A.augustum as- semblage down to 1725m and reworked A.augustum assemblage from 1730m and below, the possible time space for the 1730-1765m inter- val will be very limited and close to that of the in- terval above. A.augustum has very short time range near the top of the Paleocene. As mentioned above this interval yields com- mon Upper Cretaceous palynomorphs, mainly Upper Maastrichtian, representing all TAI cate- gories. This will say that the upper Cretaceous some distance from this locality is immature to moderately mature in strong contrast to the matu- rity level of the Cretaceous down well (TAI 5) CRETACEOUS The Cretaceous interval was not included for stratigraphic analysis, but the results from earlier investigations are summarized in Tables -F4. The preparations have been made from various depths throughout the Cretaceous interval, and the observations can be summarized like this. The entire Cretaceous interval is very mature (TAI 5), which will say that all organic materials are black. Preserved palynomorphs are rare, over long intervals extremely rare. From earlier data it is found that there is ma- jor unconformity separating the Tertiary and the Cretaceous where the upper parts of the Upper Maastrichtian and the Lower Paleocene may be missing.

Because of this apparent discrepency the MSD results were triple checked using the following methods: 1) Dips picked manually on the workstation from the FMS images in conclusive shale beds were compared with the computed dips over the same interval. These showed high degree of agreement, indicating that the MSD computation was accurate and valid. 2) As the tool uses 3-axis magnetometer system to obtain tool azimuth data, this data was checked by cross-plotting FY against FX (the magnetic field intensity on the and axes, which are normal to the tool). This plot (figure 2.5), over an interval where the tool rotated through 180, shows perfect circle. This shows that as the tool rotated, the same field intensity was measured on each magnetometer whatever to tool orientation, and this confirms that the magnetometers were functioning properly - hence the computed dip azimuths must be correct. 3) As the magnetometers also provide measurement of hole azimuth, the third check was to compare listing of hole azimuths from the FMS tool with those from completely independant well deviation survey. Again, where the two data sets were available close agreement was found between them, further supporting the accuracy of the MSD computation. This structural dip of 9 to 085 must be regarded as accurate and consistent over 500m vertical section. When this vertical continuity is considered, it has to be considered likely that this structural dip is not just localised dip around the well location, but one which could be expected to extend least 500m (ie. the extent of the vertical section) both east and west from the well location. This is large enough interval that it should be visible on a seismic section. As it is not seen, and the dip data is definitely reliable, it is recommended that the seismic data and processing parameters be checked. 2.3. Stress features around the borehole In the interval 5m (fig 2.6) an unusual feature can be observed parallel to the borehole on two opposite pads, which has the typical characteristic of an induced fracture. The feature is conductive and tracks the widest part of the borehole, yet is not absolutely straight. feature caused by some kind of scraping on the borehole wall would be much straighter and would probably not cross the borehole. The way in which the feature stops on some beds and restarts above them, and also flattens into more horizontal plane as it dies out is typical of an induced fracture according to the research on fracture propagation performed by Dowell Schlumberger. The interval of this induced fracture exactly coincides with the rathole of the previous 12.25 hole section, where the leak-off test below the 5/8 casing was performed. It is very likely then, that this fracture was induced during the leak-off test. The orientation data available from the FMS shows that the fracture is oriented with an E-W strike, which indicates that this is also the direction of present day minimum horizontal stress. In addition to this information, the recorded build-up of the leak-off test will give good indication of the mechanical behaviour of this rock and its various properties. Unfortunately, this data was acquired in Cretaceous limestone band rather than Jurassic sandstone, but the abilty to model fracture propagation in reservoir can clearly be enhanced by use of the FMS.', 'Passage_id': 1020}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 2.4. Analysis of structural features Although two structural dips zones have been identified there are number of additional questions concerning the contacts between the different formation in this well, as well as internal features. Structural features in each of the main geological groups were examined using the FMS Image Examiner workstation and the results discussed below. 2.4.1. Shetland Group (2 m) The Shetland Group consists of shales and number of carbonate units. Dips in the shales are generally less than 10 and show wide azimuthal range, suggesting that these are sedimentological variations around horizontal structure. This suggests that there was no major tectonic activity after these sediments were deposited. Dips in the carbonate units are scattered, and more detailed investigation of the FMS images revealed significant slumping - generally in N-W or occasionally N-E direction. The trends are consistent enough to conclude some sediment movement - hence general palaeoslope direction - towards the north. The slumps themselves generally have reasonable amount of coherent internal structure, the nature of which suggests that they really are the result of lateral movement rather than compaction deformation. Although the slumps themselves are - 2.0m thick, it is not clear from the images how extensive the movement was or what kind of stresses would be involved in propagating the movement. Detailed investigation of the grain types may give some indications of this. Apart from the induced fracture discussed in section 2.3. above, there is very little fracturing in the Shetland Group and most of this is related to the slumping in the carbonates. Open fractures are the most common. There is some evidence of bed truncation around 2288.5m which is more similar to minor (healed) fault than to slumping, although the two may be related. This could also be interpreted as an unconformable slide surface. The Viking Group in this well was interpreted from the open hole logs as 1.5m thick hot shale. Closer investigation from the FMS images suggests that the formation is little more than 85cm thick, from - 2292.85m, with an unconformable surface above and below. The few MSD dip patterns available suggest dips towards the east of 12-15, which is structurally consistent with dips in the Jurassic sequences below, although this is very tentative. The images indicate that the top 0.5m is actually highly deformed, and this is consistent with reworking/weathering on an unconformity surface at 2292m. The base of the Viking Group is taken as high angle (19) unconformable contact. The reason for suggesting slightly different top Brent is that the shales below 2292.8m dip at lower angle than above and appear consistently bedded downwards with no evidence of any unconformable surfaces. 2.4.3. Brent Group (2412 - m) The Brent Group in this well consists only of the Tarben and Ness Formations, with the Etive, Oseberg, Rannoch and Broom formations missing. Structural dip taken in the good shales is around 9 / 085, and is consistent with the entire section below. number of faults were observed through the Brent section and these are noted in table below. All the faults listed in the upper box display some bedding deformation on the MSD and have some distinctive trace on the FMS images. The fault at 2349.5m is less certain as there is', 'Passage_id': 1021}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Hydro A1S Well 3019-9 The Dunlin Group is an extensive and generally bioturbated shale sequence, which has been subdivided into the Drake, Cook, Burton and Amundsen formations. The 13m thick Cook sand is the only unit in the group deposited in higher energy environment, and even here no large-scale bedforms are observed. Four faults were interpreted in this interval, mainly based on discontinuous beds and high angle contacts, and most of these are thought to be small scale features with no major related fracturing. An additional fault could be interpreted at 2733.6m based on the MSD results, and although the FMS images show there is conductive event at this depth with associated fracturing, there is no distinct plane which can be measured. Throughout the rest of the interval fracturing is sporadic, and generally open fractures are observed. The faults are listed in table below. 42 / 250 56 / 166 44 / 232 34 / 265 >43 / ? 085 Table : Dunlin Faults The structural dip in the interval is very consistent overall at 8-9 / 085 except in the interval 5m. where constant dips of around 12 / 085 can be observed (see enclosres 2a and 2b). This could be interpreted as seperate small structural zone, although looked at in larger context this could also be interpreted as part of zone of generally decreasing dip angle from maximum of 16 at around 2640m down to 5 at around 2725m. The unusual feature at 2728.1m, with bedding changes around it, could in fact be major fault plane, perhaps related to some kind of block rotation occurring after the Cook formation had been deposited. It should be considered that there is no sedimentological information remaining to suggest that these dips are original sedimentary dips, hence some structural explanation is required. The history would be one of basin to the west starting to subside slowly in the early Jurassic, with sedimentation keeping pace with subsidence. This would result in dips to the west increasing in angle with depth. Toward the end of the lower Jurassic marginal listric fault developed (dipping to the west) causing roatation of the overlying sediments such that the deepest sections ended up more or less horizontal and the upper part with steeper dips to the east. The top of this section could be around 2622m where there seems to be change in the character of the images and an extensive zone of scattered MSD dips along with lower structural dip, perhaps related to changes in the depositional environment after the fault movement. It should be considered that this is tentative suggestion based purely on dipmeter and FMS data, which are not sufficient to be conclusive. However, some explanation for the dip variations is required and this one should be checked against the regional model.', 'Passage_id': 1022}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Hydro AIS Well 3019-9 no distinctive feature on the images and the distortion is restricted to specific sandstone unit. This could also be interpreted as an unconformity surface - perhaps channel infill - with draping of the sediments above. Except for the fault at 2412m these faults exhibit little or no associated fracturing, and are probably minor events. 2311.1 51 / 051 53 / 199 Table : Brent Faults Most of the Brent shows only occasional open fractures except for the zone above 2412m, which is very highly fractured (fig 2.7). Most of the fractures occur in the sand unit between 2394-2408m, and these are all cemented. This is essentially the only interval in the well where cemented fractures are observed. There is less intense fracturing in the shales above, where the fractures are all open and also show slightly different orientation. This is probably reflection on the relative mechanical properties of the two rock types. This also indicates that the fracturing pre-dated the emplacement of oil, and that the shales are sealing (ie. were sealing enough to prevent fluid migration whilst the fractures below were being cemented). More details of the actual fault contact (fig 2.8) were difficult to observe since there was washed-out coal unit immediately above the fault. Although this coal represents the base of the Brent, and is clearly faulted against the Dunlin below, it is possible that these fault features are not the main fault causing the intense fracturing. If the polar plots (figures and 2.10) are examined, it is clear that the strike orientation of the fractures is at least 45 away from the strike of the faults. It is possible that the lower 20m of the Brent represents a fault zone, with number of parallel faults. The main fault in this case would probably be cemented and obscured within the highly fractured section in the sand unit. This would suggest that the main fault through the well has NW-SE strike, rather than the N-S strike indicated from the faults which were picked. The downthrow would be to the SW and the fault plane dipping around 55-60. It is reasonable to conclude from this data that the formations missing from the lower part of the Brent have been faulted out in this well. Although the images around the base of the Brent were not perfect, the ability to make rapid and accurate fracture measurements on the workstation has enabled reasonable interpretation to be achieved; supporting the presence of fault, giving some indications of its nature and also assessing its orientation. Although fracture measurements could have been made from core, they would have taken much longer to obtain and been less accurate - assuming that core orientation was successful. In addition, much of the conclusive weight of this interpretation lies in the fact that the section above the fault contained the only significant number of healed fractures in the entire interval and was the most densly fractured. This information would not be available from core unless the entire interval was cored and analysed. This demonstrates that the FMS can be both viable alternative to oriented coring and, when properly analysed, can give significant increase to the amount of structural data available from the well. It also shows than when data is acquired over large intervals it is possible and important to interpret both log and core features in the context of the entire well rather than just on the basis of short interval.', 'Passage_id': 1023}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk llydro AIS Well 3019-9 2.4.5 Statfjord Formation (2762.5 - 2807 m) The Statfjord formation penetrated in this well consists of sandstone units with an 8m thick shale within it. No faulting was interpreted in this zone, and the structural dip information is very consistent with the overall Jurassic dip of 9 / 085. There are some open fractures in the lower sand which show NE-SW strike, in contrast to the Brent section where the strike is generall NW-SE. These were probably formed very early, and it is interesting to note that they are all open. This could imply that there has been no significant fluid migration through the Statfjord sands in this area, unlike the Brent sands in which the fluid movement which cemented the fractures probably later allowed the emplacement of oil. If true, this could mean that the Statfjord would also be water wet highjer up the structure.', 'Passage_id': 1024}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Hydro AIS Well 30/9-9 2.5. Conclusions from the structural interpretation  Two structural zones can be interpreted in this well. In the Cretaceous the beds are generally flat-lying, whilst the entire Jurassic section has structural dip of 9 / 085.  This Jurassic dip is significantly different to that seen from the seismic data. The MSD computation was triple checked and found to be both accurate and valid.  After the effects of this structural dip were removed from the MSD data, remaining zone of higher dip angles was found in the Dunlin. This could be interpreted as result of lower Jurassic basinal subsidence followed by activation of west dipping basin margin fault causing extensive rotation of the overlying sediments.  An induced fracture can be observed exactly matching the lowest part of the previous 12 1/4 hole section. This is interpreted as fracture induced during the leak-off test, and indicates an E-W minimum horizontal stress. Using the FMS in conjunction with mini- frac testing could be useful technique to model fracture propagation in the reservoir.  Extensive slumping was observed in the thin carbonate beds in the Cretaceous section. The coherence of the bedding and the style of the deformation suggests that these slumps were formed by directional movement rather than dewatering. Measurement of the fractures suggests palaeoslope dipping towards the north.  The Upper Jurassic / Cretaceous boundary is interpreted as an angular unconformity with 0.5m reworked/weathered zone below it. The Upper Jurassic / Middle Jurassic boundary is also intepreted as an unconformity, although the entire Jurassic interval appears to be structurally conformable. It is suggested that this boundary could be moved up slightly to 2292.9m  The base of the Brent is interpreted as complex normal fault zone whose main trend is striking NW-SE, dipping at 55-60 and downthrow towards the SW. The lower units of the Brent are not present in this well, and it is most likely that they were faulted out.  This analysis was achieved by extensive fracture measurements from the FMS and comparison of fracture styles over the entire logged interval which showed this faulted section to be significantly different in terms of both morphology and density. Such an analysis would not have been possible from core data alone. SKJ...S20164', 'Passage_id': 1025}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Ilydro A1S Well 3019-9 3. FACIES INTERPRETATION 3.1. Introduction The sedimentological descriptions and interpretations presented in this report are based on the integration of core, FMS and SHDT data, together with lithological information from open hole logs to provide high confidence sedimentological analysis beyond the cored intervals in this well. This analysis has provided good quality information in the Jurassic intervals in this well. However frequent bad hole sequences were encountered in the Ness formation intervals due to washout of coals and of fissile coaly claystones. Hole conditions are otherwise good and in-guage throughout most of the reservoir interval. Core photographs and 1:200 scale sedimentological description were provided by Norsk Hydro. Core to FMS depth matching is described in section 3.2. The detailed comparison of core and FMS images provided definition of the sedimentary and structural features which, in this sequence can be recognised on FMS images. This knowledge has been applied to the recognition of sedimentary detail for selected FMS intervals. Similarly, the SHDT curves and processed dip results were used to augment the interpretation. The composite SHDT plot (Enclosure 1), summarises the data set used for sedimentary description in combination with FMS images for the specified study intervals. Enclosure also encorporates the interactively picked dips, derived manually on the FMS Image Examiner workstation. These dips can be regarded as having the highest possible accuracy, since they are manually selected from images and are only verified and categorised if the interpreter can recognise the bedding type. These are colour coded on this display under the categories: erosional surfaces (magenta) faults/fractures (blue/yellow), cross bedding (red) and bedding dip (green). These results are structural dip removed on the basis of structural analysis in the preceding sections.', 'Passage_id': 1026}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 3.2. Core-log depth match After examination of the summary core description and core photographs supplied by Norsk Hydro, the following firm depth matches were made by comparison with images on the FMS Image Examiner workstation. The image enhancement option on this workstation was utilised for clarification of correlation markers in zones of poor resistivity contrast. The borehole images have enabled the moderately fragmented core to be placed back on depth with respect to logs. For most correlation points, core orientation has been provided. These are summarised in the tabulation below, and the correlation points are marked on the annotated FMS plots of enclosures 6a-6d. On these plots, the abbreviation cp appears in the note track at the relevant FMS depth and the core depth is also quoted. By using the FMS image examiner, these orientation data from FMS are accurate with respect to horizontal or vertical reference to + or - degree of azimuth. Core orientation surveys are quoted as having + or - degrees azimuth accuracy at best (Nelson et al, 1987). Core Depth Core FMS Depth Depth Shift Dip/Azi Core Table 3: FMS-Core depth-shifts, 30/9-9.

Log quality Control The FMS images from this well are of good quality throughout due to the exellent hole conditions. The hole is generally in guage and regular, the engineers field print showed resistivity character to be active with good pad to pad correlation and within dynamic measurement range throughout, tool rotation rate is well within tolerance and there are no zones of thick mudcake buildup. The hole characteristics of this well can be compared directly with image quality on enclosures 3-5 as the pad -2 and pad -4 caliper dimensions are presented on track two of these plots. Severe washouts do however occur in the majority of coals encountered in this well. Where coals have been washed out, images become defocussed and lack geological character (Figure 3.11). These are Borehole wall artifacts, and are defined as that group of images arising from physical characteristics of the borehole. in Bourke (1989). The dark image tones in such zones represent the high conductivity of drilling mud in the washout. Where coals have not given rise to enlargement of the borehole, they are generally light i.e. resistive in character. Where coals have washed out, the bed boundaries of this lithology can still be accurately picked from images to aid in core depth matching since core recovery is also influenced by the fissility of coals.', 'Passage_id': 1028}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Ilydro AIS Well 3019-9 3.4. Fades recognition from FMS images Examination of cores confirmed that limited range of sedimentary features are present in the interval of interest. The FMS could be used to recognise the majority of these. Features recognised on FMS in this well include:  small synsedimentary slumps  deformed soft sediment injection structures  bioturbation  millimetre thick silt beds in argillaceous intervals  sand lenses  cross bedding  Rooted horizons  Coals  erosion surfaces  bed breakup horizons  patchy cements (calcite)  bed boundary degree of planarity The most significant of the above listed features are further discussed below. All the above listed features are annotated where relevant on the FMS summary enclosures at the back of this report. 3.4.1. Soft sediment slumps: These features are recognised on images at number of intervals both within and beyond the cored section. Soft sediment deformation features have been noted at number of horizons in the Ness and Statfjord formations. Soft sediment deformation appears to have occurred most frequently within and at the bed margin to channel sands and channel fills. (eg Figures and 3.2) These features appear to vary in size according to bed thickness, giving an observed size range of 0.2m (Figure 3.3) to 2m (Figure 3.1). Minor soft sediment injection features such as ptygmatically deformed sandstone dykes were locally recognisable on borehole images. These features were small scale and will not tend to be seen on cores and images at the same horizon because they occur sporadically and will not extend latterally from the borehole wall to core. These injection features occur mainly at bed boundaries, and in particular in argillaceous sediments. These features could easily be confused with large vertical burrow escape structures on images, though few large vertical burrows were apparently noted on cores.', 'Passage_id': 1029}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 3.4.2. Bioturbation: Large vertical escape burrows were briefly discussed above, but it is the more ubiquitous bioturbation destratification which is more important in terms of reservoir quality indication. Bioturbated intervals generally have argillaceous log response due to dispersed detrital clay, and this facies type is generally visible on images due to resistivity contrast between clean and argillaceous sands. These argillaceous sandstones are generally obvious on cores for similar reasons. Such features on FMS images usually display mottling on 2-4cm scale, burrows may also tend to be flattened in horizontal orientation due to compaction. e.g. Compare the large burrows in Figures and with the fine compacted intense bioturbation in the argillaceous facies in Figure 3.14. In relatively clean sandstone sequences it is easy to confuse bioturbation with pebbly horizons. In this well, pebbly intervals appear to be rare or virtually absent. However when present, pebbles can often be distinguished on the basis that they exhibit resistive (light) and conductive (dark) mottles of regular size. The latter are probably mud filled holes where large grains have been plucked from the borehole wall during drilling. Bioturbation mottling tends to be more uniform in resistivity character. Note also that bioturbation in clean sandstone seen on FMS images may not always obviously mottled on core. The lack of dispersed clay in such beds render the mottling in clean sand intervals invisible on core. However, resistivity images pick up these features due to the subtle permeability variations seen as differential saturation images. (Note:Detailed minipermeameter imaging in apparently massive sandstones has shown the presence of permeability heterogeneity which can be observed on FMS images in other wells examined by Integrated Geological Services. These heterogeneities are often due to bioturbation destratification, but similar features have also been noted from dewatered sediments.) 3.4.3. Cross bedding: Large scale traction current features are seen on core in this well and are also recognisable on FMS images. Recognition is generally attributed to discordant bedding surfaces seen on borehole images. Further evidence of bedding discordancy on borehole images can be provided by projecting 3D plots from the borehole images on the workstation (Figure 3.9). Quite small ripple laminations can be seen on images from this well in both shaly sands and in clean sands ( Figures 3.5, 3.6, 3.8). Azimuth histograms of apparent cross bedding are useful in distinguishing cross bedding type. Planar cross bedding displays good cross borehole planarity and therefore has low azimuth dispersion while trough cross bedding will display high azimuthal scatter. Azimuth histograms of cross bedding selected for further paleocurrent consideration in section are presented in Figure 3.16. The high degree of azimuth scatter displayed for these bedforms would suggest that they are most probably trough cross bedding, note that the histogram plots in this figure have not been corrected for structural dip. Cross bedding at the time of deposition was more extensive and has suffered reworking by bioturbation destratification and through slumping. number of bedded intervals were categorised as cross bedding on the FMS Image Examiner workstation in the Ness and Statfjord formations and are presented as red correlation lines and tadpoles in the FMS summary enclosures. The interpreters ability to pick such features as cross bedding tends to be superior on borehole images relative to core because borehole images offer wider perspective of medium to large scale sedimentary features than core.

Dips determined from FMS images are summarised as magenta correlation lines on the FMS summary Enclosures. In particular discordant bed contact was noted at or near the Top Amundsen formation at circa 2735.4m This probably represents disconformable bed contact. Some probable fault contacts were also noted on FMS images, eg circa 2728m (Figure 3.14) 3.4.5 Cemented fractures: Fractures are not major feature in the reservoir interval in this well. However, zones of apparently cemented conjugate fracture sets have been recognised in FMS images particularly in the lower part of the Ness formation and confirmed from core. (eg. circa 2399m, and see Figure 1.15). Minor bed displacement is apparent at bed boundaries. Conjugate fractures also display section loss and offset implying displacement and possible pressure solution along fracture planes, this later observation would require confirmation by petrographic analysis. Minor fracturing can be recognised at number of additional intervals on FMS images and generally show minor or no obvious displacement and poor cross borehole distribution, particularly in the Statfjord formation sandstones in this well. Fracture analysis from FMS images is fully dicussed in this report in section 3. 3.5. Discussion of facies from zones of interest 3.5.1: Brent Group. From 2275m downwards is complex interbedded sequence of cross bedded and channel fill sandstones; deformed sandstones and argillaceous wavy laminated (eg.2296.5m) and bioturbated units. Small ripple laminated sets occur locally eg circa 2297.5m. Large scale, cross borehole correlatable cross beds are also recognisable in this interval circa 2306m. From 2311m downwards, intebedded apparently in-situ coals interbedding with claystones, biotubated argilaceous sediments and minor sandstones are obvious on images. Sandstones are frequently distorted and contain common small traction current features. The inter-relationship between sedimentary units increases in complexity downwards. The sand sequence towards the base of the Brent interval in this well is often intensely fractured. Fracturing has frequently masked primary bedding detail in this well. 3.5.2: Cook Formation. From 2627m downwards to 2639m, comprising compactionally enhanced lamination on images. This bedding includes flattened burrows highlighted by probable variations in silt or fine sand content. Local transitions from fine bedded burrows to larger probably pyritic burrows can be discerned. Top Cook is picked on images at circa 2639m where heterogeneous probably intensely bioturbate,d sandstones are observed. Gross overall bedding can be recognised occationally , highlighted by calcareously cemented zones. From 2642m downwards, the sequence becomes increasingly well laminated, with local intense bioturbation. Occational more massive sands are frequently slumped or deformed, with rare load casted bed bases. Clay draped ripple laminated sandstones occur at circa 2649m and 2650.5m.

Conclusions from the facies interpretation  FMS images were examined in conjunction with open hole log data to provide an anotated facies description and manual dip analysis in the Brent Group, Cook and Statfjord Formations. Core and FMS images were directly compared and core to image correlation points established throughout the cored interval. Image quality is very good throughout the logged interval except in the vicinity of coal beds where severe washout occur giving rise to artifact images, nonetheless coals can be categorically recognised on this basis.  The Ness formation was found to be lithologically complex and most sedimentary structures in this Formation can be recognised directly from images, examples of facies types from this formation are illustrated in figures at the back of this report. limited range of facies types are present in the Cook Formation in this well and can be confidently recognised from images, this facies was found to be highly bioturbated and highly argillaceous. The Statfjord formation was found to be dominated by bionirbation mottled sediments but cross bedding was examined at number of intervals.  Manually picked cross bedding dips were analysed azimuthally and structural dip removed to provide indications of sediment transport direction. Image binarisation on the FMS image Examiner workstation was attempted in selected intevals as technique for derivation of net sand count from images.', 'Passage_id': 1032}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Hydro AIS Well 30/9-9 4. DEPOSITIONAL INTERPRETATION 4.1. Depositional model It was not within the remit of this report to review the depositional model of the field. However the facies information furnished in the FMS annotated summary plots of enclosures 6a-6d should provide useful additional sedimentological data for Norsk Hydro sedimentology group as input to extending depositional interpretation beyond cored intervals. 4.2. Paleocurrent indications Analysis of FMS images on the FMS Image Examiner workstation offers major improvement in directional dip data quality. The interpreter only verifies and classifies dips that he has confidently identified, thus greatly improving interpretation confidence. However these dips are only meaningful if they are applied in directional context with respect to the correct depositional model. Good image quality was acheived throughout the logged interval. Cross bedding can be recognised in many of the sandstone intervals in the Ness and Statfjord formations ranging in set height from 0.05m (Figure 2307m) to approximately lm. Interactive dip picking was only carried out in the larger cross borehole correlatable bedforms. These larger bedforms are also assumed to be the most reliable paleocurrent indicators. Many of the cross bedded sequences observed could not be analysed because of bed deformation due to slumping. e.g. Figure 3.1. Undoubtedly many bioturbated zones were originally cross bedded and have subsequently been bioturbation destratified. Finally where fracturing has occurred, the highly resistive fracture fills have masked primary bedding character. The zones which have been analysed are the most obvious ones, image enhancement has highlighted locally that rather more cross bedding could be revealed by systematic enhancement analysis (e.g. Figure 3.3). This is something which might be considered for further future work. Cross bed azimuth histograms, non dip removed and dip removed for selected uppermost Brent (Ness) and Statfjord formation bedding are presented in figures and respectively. The 19 dips picked from the upper part of the Brent formation exhibit dominant 180 bimodal distribution NNW and SSE. These two populations show low scatter and are probably due to planar cross bedding, which would most typically occur in marine lower shoreface setting. These are large low amplitude bedforms, and could result from tidal influence, this interpretation could arguably be supported by the extreme bimodal distribution of these dominant bedforms, reflecting ebb and flood tidal flow patterns. The subordinate westerly pattern in the upper Brent shows high azimuth scatter more typical of smaller high energy trough crossbeds. These could represent the regionally influenced drainage direction of minor distributary channel. The 11 dips picked from the Statfjord formation display wide scatter, though two minor populations can be noted with dominantly SSW and SSE azimuths. The bedforms within these populations display low azimuth scatter and are therefore likely to be planar cross beds. The data set for this formation is rather small, but these two dominant populations could indicate an overall southerly transport direction for these sediments. This hypothesis requires careful examination in terms of the regional depositional model.', 'Passage_id': 1033}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Ilydro A1S Well 3019-9  4.3. Reservoir quality indicators FMS image quality in well 30/9-9 was found to be good with good definition of wide range of sedimentary structures of varying size range. Such information is potentially useful for reservoir characterisation and as input to petrophysical analysis (FMS images could be used to establish whether particular shale unit was 100% pure shale or silt bearing). FMS images can be used in sands with marked shale response to determine whether these clays are dispersed or ordered on small scale. For example, in bioturbateri zones biogenically dispersed detrital clays may drastically reduce reservoir transrnicibility. In comparison however, in clay draped ripple laminated sequence, clays could be concentrated between ripple sets leaving potentially good lateral transmiscibility. e.g. Compare the bioturbated sandstone images in Figure circa 2298.5m with the wavy clay draped sandstones in Figure at circa 2296.7m. The latter has higher sand content with more ordered bedding. Recognition of fractures in reservoir zones could be crutial to an understanding of reservoir behaviour. Clearly while open fractures could be potentially beneficial to reservoir depletion, cemented fractures in matrix producing reservoir sandstones could effectively compartmentalise large matrix blocks. Conjugate fracture sets were noted in the lower part of the Ness formation in this well. They should be petrographically investigated to asses their potential influence on transrniscibility. The image binarisation option on the Image Examiner workstation was utilised in two short intervals where determination of net sand count has been carried out by Norsk Hydro. The image binarisation technique allows the FMS interpreter to manually set resistivity cutoff points for the displayed resistivity data for an interval on the workstation screen. The resistivity shading on screen can be interactively adjusted until narrow resistivity range is displayed for the screen interval. Thus for instance, conductive open fractures could be highlighted and the primary bedding detail behind subdued. The percentage of black conductive events (fractures) can then be read directly from the screen display. Similarly the relative percentages of sand and claystone, or shaly sand and clean sand could be determined, even in thin bedded sequences. Two selected examples of net sand determination are illustrated in Figures and 3.19. This technique could probably be applied with some precision over large intervals of reservoir by calibrating from core by rninipermeameter.', 'Passage_id': 1034}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Norsk Hydro AIS Well 30I9-9 5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  Structural dip has been interpreted in two main zones. The Jurassic interval shows structural dip @90 different to that expected from the seismic interpretation. number of checks were made on the dip data, confirming that it is correct, and it is recommended that the seismic processing parameters be re-evaluated.  number of normal faults were interpreted in this well, although only the fault around the base of the Brent (@2412m) is thought to be significant. This is probably complex normal fault zone with extensive related fracturing, the main trend of which is believed to be striking NW-SE, downthrown to the SW and dipping at around 55-60. This interpretation would not have been possible without the use of the FMS, even using the core which was available over this interval.  Very extensive cemented conjugate fracture sets were observed above this fault, and may locally affect production from this well. Cemented fracturing is only thought likely to be found in the vicinity of larger faults, and not dominant throughout the reservoir sands.  possible Lower Jurassic listric fault could be interpreted around 2728m. This would be west dipping and responsible for rotation of the overlying sediments. The fault would have been active in the later part of the Lower Jurassic.  Fractured intervals were quite obvious on FMS in this well due to the resistivity contrast between the matrix rock and cement or conductive mud fill. Fractures were interpreted as cemented or open as far as possible and accurate fracture data has been provided in combination with structural data from conventional dipmeter processing. Where present in high densities, fractures do tend to mask primary bedding to the detriment of facies analysis from images.  An induced fracture created by the 5/8 leak-off test is interpreted in the upper part of this well. This fracture indicates minimum present-day horizontal stress in an E-W direction.  FMS image quality is generally good throughout the entire logged interval of the Cretaceous and Jurassic sections of well 30/9-9, with the exception of severe hole washout in coal sections. wide range of sedimentary structures can be confidently recognised, providing useful reservoir characterisation to supplement petrophysical analysis in complex lithologies and to provide quite detailed facies description beyond cored intervals.  The FMS in combination with lithological information from open hole logs has provided detailed sedimentological profile in the logged interval. Comparison of FMS images with cored intervals in this well has established high level of confidence for FMS based facies analysis beyond cored intervals in the Oseberg vicinity.  Core to image depth matching has been acheived throughout the cored interval. Cores can now be compared more directly with other open hole logs and many core features can be oriented within the reservoir framework. In this well the core could have been oriented from the FMS alone.  Cross bedded sequences were recognised in clean sandstones at number of horizons in both Ness and Statfjord formations. Cross beds and clay draped ripples could be recognised, often when only 0.05m in hieght. Paleocurrent analysis was attempted only on the larger bedforms which are presumed to be the most reliable current indicators. The accuracy of paleocurrent observations from these features is controlled by confidence of structural dip determination and our understanding of the relationship of these bcdforms to the overall field depositional model.', 'Passage_id': 1035}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 1. INTRODUCTION Well 3019-9 Prior to the introduction of the Formation MicroScanner (FMS) tool in 1985, interpretation of geological features within the wellbore involved analysis of indirect geophysical measurements such as curves or dip results. The Borehole Televiewer (BHTV) had been developed as an imaging device in the 1960's (Zemanek et al, 1969), but images could not provide sufficient resolution for detailed analysis of sedimentary features or healed fracture systems. With the FMS came revolution in geological interpretation from wireline log data: detailed geological features on the borehole wall could now be seen as microresistivity images. The purpose of this paper is to describe the FMS tool development, acquisition technology and operational recommendations, and image processing and display techniques. 2. TOOL HISTORY The FMS tool is the latest development of microresistivity logging, using focused resistivity measurements to yield more detailed information about the formation being logged. The tool began with the idea of super-.dipmeter, development of the two-button Stratigraphic High Resolution Dipmeter Tool (SHDT), and it was envisaged that fractures could be identified by correlation of pairs of microresistivity electrodes within an array. Initially, this array was circular, but this was later changed to linear array which could cover the same area with fewer electrodes. The most critical evolutionary step in the history of the tool was the realisation that the electrodes could be used to generate microresistivity images of the borehole wall, thus enabling identification of fractures and bedding features. The initial prototype one-pad, 40-button tool (Ekstrom et al, 1986) was tested in various parts of the world, including the Southern North Sea in 1984-85 (Frisinger and Gyllensten, 1986, Plumb and Luthi, 1986, Luthi and Banavar, 1988), and was variously named the Micro Scanning Tool (MST) and Formation Imaging Dipmeter Tool (FIDT). The two-pad, 54-button (i.e. 27-buttons per pad) Micro-Electrical Scanning Tool (MEST) was field tested in Northern Europe in 1985 (Lloyd et al, 1986), and was introduced commercially into the U.K. in 1986 as the Formation MicroScanner (FMS) tool. This was the standard FMS tool used in the North Sea until 1988, when the four-pad, 64-button (i.e. 16 electrodes per pad) FMS tool was introduced (Biischer, 1989). As both the 2-pad and 4-pad tools have been used in the U.K. recently, both tool designs and processing will be discussed herein. The basic principle of the FMS tool is to map the conductivity of the borehole wall with dense array of sensors. The tool itself is similar to an SHDT tool, in that the lower section of the tool emits current (the EMEX current) into the formation, which returns to the metal housing of the tool above an insulating sleeve. small proportion of the current, flowing from the button array, is recorded as series of individual microresistivity curves sampled at vertically. The rest of the current serves to focus this electrode current giving measurement which has shallow depth of investigation and a very good vertical resolution. The level of EMEX current is dynamically controlled to optimise tool performance in formations of different or varying resistivities. An inclinometry section, within the insulating sleeve, consists of both triaxial accelerometer and magnetometers which enable speed corrections to be made and the tool orientation to be determined.

The electrodes in the arrays are 0.2 in diameter, and are arranged in four rows, giving 50% overlap. In addition to these microresistivity arrays, the tool also has the eight standard SHDT electrodes, plus two speed electrodes. The SHDT curves acquired from these electrodes are used for dip computation, while the images are processed from the 54 array electrodes. Borehole coverage with the 2-pad FMS tool is limited to two sides of the borehole wall only (i.e. 20% coverage with one logging pass in an hole). To overcome this limitation it was necessary to run the tool several times over the zone of interest, which is time consuming and requires the tool to be rotated so that the pads with the electrode arrays trail along the opposite side of the well, feat not always achieved, particularly in deep and deviated wells. In addition, depth-matching between passes is not simple, as images require matching to an accuracy of 0.5 (at several thousand feet!), and this takes up considerable amount of analyst time. 3.2. 4-pad FMS tool The limitations of the 2-pad FMS tool have been overcome by placing imaging electrode arrays on all four pads of an FMS sonde. This 4-pad FMS tool has four identical pads, each with sixteen microresistivity electrodes in two-row array (64 electrodes in total). The electrodes are in diameter, slightly larger than the electrodes in the 2-pad tool, and the overlap between buttons is reduced slightly to 39%. This new configuration increases the borehole coverage to 40% in an hole, and no reduction in image quality is noted (Biischer, 1989). The main advantages of this new design are that only one logging pass is required to provide large borehole coverage (as with the 2-pad tool further passes may be run to increase coverage), thus saving logging time, and improvements are also noted in terms of automatic data processing. In addition, the larger electrode diameter gives more favourable response, and helps to provide better signal in zones affected by mudcake or rugose borehole. 3.3. Tool limitations The major tool limitation is that it can only be used in conductive muds. major study was carried out in 1987-1988 in the North Sea and other parts of the world investigating the potential of the tool when run in oil based mud (Hastings et al, 1988). This study showed that while the tool could pick up some geological features (fractures, major lithology changes, bedding within mudstones, large conglomerate clasts etc.), the images were severely affected by borehole rugosity, mudcake, and lack of resistivity contrast within the formation. Image quality is much poorer than when run in similar formations in water-based mud, and the definition of geological features is not guaranteed. The use of FMS logs in oil based mud is not recommended, however good results are obtained where there is up to 20% oil in the mud system (i.e. the continuous phase is water, and the mud is conductive, Lloyd et al, 1986). The FMS tool has been run succesfully in horizontal wells, using the TLC logging system (i.e. the tool is logged on the bottom of drillpipe, Pilenko, 1988). Little reduction in data quality is noted, however the uppermost FMS pad may in places exhibit standoff from the top of the borehole, giving poor quality image. Interpretation of features striking along the wellbore and subhorizontal features is difficult from horizontal wells. No floating pad problems should be encountered below 70 deviation.

When the tool is against resistive unit, the voltage is increased, thus allowing significant amount of current to enter the formation. Conversely, when the tool is against conductive formation, the voltage is decreased, thus lowering the current intensity and preventing electronic saturation. As result raw FMS image does not represent true variations in formation resistivity. The EMEX correction applied during FMS processing corrects for this variation, and allows large-scale resistivity variations to be examined.  Dead button correction: In some cases, one or two FMS buttons on pad may show flat responses. This dead button response may be corrected by direct interpolation between the neighbouring buttons without significant loss of data resolution. 2. Image generation and display The basic principle of FMS image generation is to map the FMS corrected curve traces into grey-level or colour-scale log. With most imaging devices, limited number of shades are possible, related to the usual pixel size. The FMS resistivity information from each trace is split into seventeen bands (if grey-scaling is used), and composite image is built up from each of the array traces. Because of the greater sensitivity of the human eye to colour changes, larger number of shades are possible with colour graphics, whether on paper plots or on the FMS Image Examiner workstation (Boyeldieu and Jeffreys, 1988). FMS data may be displayed in either curve (wiggle trace) or image modes, both allowing different perception of the data. In addition, the images may be displayed azimuthally orientated or unorientated ). The unorientated or straight plots are used at small scale (e.g. 1:200) so that image character is not affected by rotation. The azimuthally orientated images (commonly referred to as BORMAP plots) are akin to an unwrapped representation of the borehole wall, and allow the visualisation of features with respect to orientation, the merging of several passes, and the plotting of dip data as sine curves directly on the images. Orientated images are normally used at large scale (e.g. 1:10, 1:5). Using the FMS Image Examiner workstation, the images can also be displayed as 3-dimensional cylinder, representing view from outside the wellbore. This is useful for visualising complex structures or when the well is highly deviated. 3. Contrast enhancement It is difficult with limited colour-scale image to display all the scales of variation present in the image. For example, it is not possible to show variation related to major lithology change from anhydrite into water-bearing sandstone and at the same time show detailed variation in formation character within each of these units. Therefore contrast enhancement is both necessary and possible with FMS images, and number of different techniques are available.  Static normalisation: This technique determines the grey-scale class limits from mean and variance of data computed using resistivity histogram of the entire processed interval. In essence, the resistivity grey scale is normalised over the entire processed interval, with the effect that identical grey shades anywhere on the plot represent the same resistivity levels, and therefore gross variations of resistivity are shown.  Dynamic normalisation: In this case the grey-scale class limits are determined using the mean and variance of histogram of short (2-3ft) sliding window. The class limits are assigned to the central line of each window before the window moves up one sample and', 'Passage_id': 1038}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 30/9-9 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: NS Ilydro AIS repeats the process. In this case the resultant grey shades can only be compared over short distances, and no comparison can be made between resistivity changes over an interval larger than one window-length. It is therefore important to use this data in conjunction with statically normalised reference plot. The advantage of dynamic normalisation is the enhancement of small-scale features not picked up by the static normalisation process.  Dynamic histogram normalisation (HILITE): This enhancement uses the full histogram of the resistivity data within sliding window to drive the grey-scale class limits instead of just mean and variance. The goal is to use the entire grey-scale within one window-length, with approximately the same number or points in each grey class. As consequence, small details are made visible in the resulting plot, but care is required as noise may also be enhanced.  Interactive enhancement: Using the FMS Image Examiner workstation (Boyeldieu and Jeffreys, 1988), section of FMS image may be enhanced interactively on the screen to highlight or suppress detail. It is important to be aware when enhancing FMS images that in some short zones such as carbonate concretions, the resistivity contrast between the concretion and the surrounding rock is so high that the EMEX voltage did not have time to respond and the tool could not acquire sufficient detail. No amount of enhancement can retrieve this detail.  5. SUMMARY Well 30I9-9 1. The FMS tool provides detailed microresistivity images of the borehole wall. 2. Two versions of the tool have been in common use, the 2-pad tool (27 electrodes par pad), superceded in 1989 by the 4-pad tool (16 electrodes per pad). The advantages of the 4-pad tool are: i) Only one logging pass required. ii) Good borehole coverage (e.g. gives 40% borehole coverage in an hole with one pass). iii) No depth-matching required. iv) The larger electrode diameter gives better response, especially in zones affected by mudcake or poor hole conditions. 3. FMS logs can be processed to produce both dip results and images. Dip processing produces the standard SHDT MSD, LOCDIP, CSB and 4-SBS results, plus unique flow-line based dip from images (FMSDIP). Before production of images, data is first corrected for velocity variations and variations of EMEX current, and equalised to compensate for different electrical characteristics of the electrodes. Images may be displayed as grey-scale or colour images, orientated, unorientated, or as 3-dimensional cylinder plot. Images can also be enhanced to highlight or suppress features, either by standard processing or using an interactive workstation.

To reduce the background radiation, the detector and the samples were shielded by lead.

The implication for maturation, migration and preservation of hydrocarbons are also well known, in theory. The magnitude of the erosion is, however, less known and great efforts have been made to quantify the erosion and its variations throughout the Barents Sea. As new contribution to this, we have initiated the testing of new type of analysis. Geotechnical engineers have for 20-30 years applied compressional tests, so-called oedometer tests, to measure the maximum load of previous overburden on non-lithified soil samples. The Sintef Division of Geotechnical Engineering has been one of leading institutes on this research, and in co-operation with IKU they have built special oedometer test rig for bedrock samples. The objective of this has been to investigate whether the well established theory and procedures on soil samples analysis could be transferred to bedrock samples. Nine core samples were subjected to analysis in the new test rig, six from the two cores north of the Nordkapp Basin and three from the coastal area. Cores with slightly different lithologies and from different stratigraphic intervals were selected. The technical part of the analyses was very successful with unambiguous and slightly different results for the two areas. The technique, the laboratory analyses and the results are presented by the Division of Geotechnical Engineers in the report below. A.4.2 Thin section studies In order to study the diagenesis of the analysed cores, thin sections were prepared of six of the samples. These are from 7430/07-U-01 (47.93 m, (75.26 m). mas_bsmpOl/report88/ab6=a1/2/mas/13-FEB-89', 'Passage_id': 1043}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7127/10-U-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: -A.4.3- Core 7430/07-U-01 CD ..t Eg 47.93 in and in: Both samples are grain supported siltstones with grain size 20-30 um. Pyrite and siderite cement occur as patchy distributed clusters. The siderite is microcrystalline and seems in most cases to replace detrital biotite. Quartz cementation is commonly observed (recognized as tight, long grain contacts). The abundance of quartz cements is, however, difficult to estimate due to the small size and lack of dust rims on the host grains. 103.30 in: This is slightly porous (estimated to <5% under the optical microscope), grain supported, siltstone to very fine-grained sandstone (40-100 um).

The latter seems to be confined to the coarser grained laminae. 48.02 in: The sample is thinly laminated organic rich claystone/slightly silty shale.

In short it was measured preconsolidation stress of -40 MPa in the northern area and 30-35 MPa in the coastal area. If these values are directly considered to reflect the load of previous overburden, they correspond to sediment thicknesses in the order of 3-3.5 km in the northern areas and 2.5-3 km in the southern area. As is concluded in the laboratory report, there is no doubt that this conclusion is incorrect, because the sedimentary bedrock samples have experienced diagenetic processes with cementing between grains, compared to soil samples where this has not occurred and more or less simple compression has taken place. In most of the samples described above, several neoformed minerals are observed (clay minerals, quartz, carbonate and pyrite). The effect of the diagenesis must therefore be estimated before the measured values can be compared with previous sediment load. But if this can be quantified, we strongly believe that oedometer tests will provide reliable values of the overburden. The difference in measured value between the two areas and similar and very confident results in another IKU project support this. Unfortunately time did not allow further petrographic analyses of the samples, but quantitative SEM and XRD analyses will probably help us further on. In conclusion we would tend to believe that the oedometer analysis reflects difference in erosion between the two areas, but that the effect of diagenesis will reduce the overburden estimates to certain and at present unknown degree. mas_bsinp01/report88/ab6=a1/4/mas/13-FEB-89', 'Passage_id': 1045}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7127/10-U-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: ENUEP 2,2POLT: Report no.

The main findings are: - All tests from about 7420'N, 30E revealed preconsolidation stress of 40 MPa - All tests from the Finnmark East Area revealed preconsolidation stress of 30-35 MPa - This indicates that the sedimentary rocks in question cored from present depths 50-125 with present effective vertical stresses of 0.5-1.5 MPa, could previously have been overlain by either 3.0-4.5 km ice thickness or roughly 2.5-4 km of sediments which now-have been eroded.

SINTEF, Division of Geotechnical Engineering obtained samples from depths 48 to 125 below the seabed at latitudes 7054 to 7426'N, and longitudes 2705' to 3014'E. Several different lithological units were tested. The testing was carried out in new oedometer rig, designed for testing sedimentary rocks up to vertical stress level of 90 to 120 MPa. The results have been interpreted in the same manner as in geotechnical engineering, using the NTH- models of soil behaviour /1/. It was found that in all tests the stress-strain-time behaviour was in principle identical to well-established soil behaviour, the only difference being that the absolute values of the resistances of the rock samples were of course much larger than similar soils, say of Quaternary age. The main findings can briefly be summarized as follows: 0 The test material from site 7430/07-U-01, taken from depths 48 to 125 below the seabed, showed precon- solidation stress level around 40 MPa, as compared to the present overburden of to MPa. The compression modulus around Cc' was found to be in the range to GPa, 0 The test materials from site 7430/10-U-01 taken from depths 48 to 66 below the seabed, showed the same preconsolidation stress level as at site 7430/07-U-01. The modulus in the 0C-range were around GPa.\", 'Passage_id': 1047}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7127/10-U-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 0 The test material from sites 7127/10-U-02, 125 respectively, showed preconsolidation stress of 30-35 MPa. The modulus in the 0C-range were around 0.6 GPa. The preconsolidation stresses obtained for the clay-type materials are approximately the same whether interpreted from the stress-strain-, the modulus-stress-, or the creep-stress- curves, or even semi-empirical rules. Typical for all curves are the breakdown of rigidity of the grain structure around the preconsolidation stress. This effect is most evident in the change of creep behaviour, exactly as previously observed for Quaternary soils of much lesser density, rigidity and strength. The preconsolidation stress for some silt/sand-type materials are often difficult to interpret from strain-stress or modul- us-stress curves. In such cases the change in creep behaviour may be the best way to reveal oc'. This creep procedure has therefore been applied to all samples reported herein.\", 'Passage_id': 1048}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7127/10-U-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The modulus concept was first introduced by Janbu /1/ in 1963. The definitions of the modulus and the time resistance are shown in Fig. 2. The axial strain (e) at the end of each loadstep is plotted versus effective stress (0'), and the tangent modulus to this curve (M) can be plotted versus aver- age effective stress (6'). For low stress on the loading branch the resistance (M) against deformation is large. While the stress increases this high resistance eventually decreas- es appreciably, owing to partial collapse of the grain skele- ton. This breakdown of the resistance occurs around the pre- consolidation stress level c'. When the effective stress is increased beyond cc the resistance increases with increasing effective stress. The behaviour in the normally consolidated stress range can be approximated by linear oedometer modu- lus as shown in Fig. 2. The tangent to the strain-time curve of each load step is defined as the time resistance (R). Irrespective of whether > cc' linear dependency of the time resistance is found after some elapsed time for each load level. The time resis- tance number (rs) can be found as straight line fit to the R-t-curve. When plotting the time resistance number versus effective stress the preconsolidation stress (cc') can be interpreted from the lowest point of the rs-o'-curve. This method of interpreting the preconsolidation stress can often be more precise than interpretation of cc' from either the e-a' or the M-3'-curves. A linear time resistance indicatesa creep behaviour. There- fore, the term creep resistance is also used more frequently. As consequence rs is also called the creep number.\", 'Passage_id': 1049}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7127/10-U-3 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: A total number of oedometer samples of sedimentary rocks from the western part of the Barents Sea have been tested.

In station file no.29, total volume of 75 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the LDP. One gallon SC (SN: 121) and one MPSR (SN: 60) was filled. The sampled fluid is predicted to be dry gas. In station file no. 30, total volume of 26 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the LDP. One MPSRs (SN: 758) was filled. The sampled fluid is predicted to be dry gas. The time interval of  minute in station file no.30 is chosen for the fluid composition display on the depth view plot, before the pump was started. The maximum drawdown was approximately bars, while pretest drawdown mobility was mD/cP in station file no.29. Run Station 31 (611.0 MD): total volume of 48 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the LDP. One gallon SC (SN: 133) and two MPSRs (SN: 4434 & 3607) were filled. The sampled fluid is predicted to be dry gas. The time interval chosen from the fluid fraction display on the depth view plot is 56 - 58 minutes, before the second last sample was taken. The maximum drawdown was approximately bars, while pretest drawdown mobility was 1023.40 mD/cP. Run Station 32 (613.3 MD): total volume of 30 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the QS including in commingled flow and in split flow (23 from guard line and from sampling line). No sample was taken at this depth. The scanned fluid is predicted to be formation water with traces of gas. The time interval chosen from the fluid fraction display on the depth view plot is 39  41 minutes, after the pump was stopped. The maximum drawdown was approximately 25 bars, while pretest drawdown mobility was mD/cP. Run Station 33 (615.5 MD): total volume of 214 was pumped out from formation at this depth using the QS including in commingled flow and in split flow (114.2 from guard line and 98 from sampling line). Two MPSRs (SN: 4036 & 3961) were filled. The sampled fluid is predicted to be water with dry gas (less than station no.32). The time interval chosen from the fluid fraction display on the depth view plot is 76  77 minutes, before the last sample was taken. The maximum drawdown was approximately bars, while pretest drawdown mobility was mD/cP. 1 R.R. Jackson, A. Carnegie, F.X. Dubost, 2007.

The Optimized Test consists of multiple repeat tests of up to three drawdown-buildup (DD-BU) cycles for each test station. They are represented by three individual final buildup pressures and three mobility values. The latter are calculated using tool internal algorithm, which is based on Formation Rate Analysis FRASM (see below for further information). The measurements are taken while circulating (flow-on). The before and after annulus pressure measurements are influenced by hydrodynamic effects and do not represent hydrostatic mud pressure. The formation pressure measurement is, under normal conditions, not affected by the mud flow. Client Delivery Package Two types of the Client Delivery Package are offered. Both packages include reports, data plots and data files of each run, performed with TesTrak: The Standard package mainly comprises automatically created reports and data files, delivered real-time as well as right after tool memory dump ('Rig-Floor' delivery). These are: Uplink Table, Run Summary Report, and LAS files. In addition, the Extended package includes detailed interpretation of each test. This package is delivered only on request. The interpretation within comprises an analysis based on FRA, which is well-known from Baker Atlas wireline service, such as RCITM. Data are delivered with the FRA Report. Uplink-Table (Real-time) A Microsoft Excel table that contains real-time data of each test-station performed. Besides the most important data - depth, pressure and mobility - it comprises large variety of information, which helps to make further decisions real-time. Some of them are lowest DD pressure, temperature gradient, or overall test time (including pad eject, testing and retract). As an additional feature, quality indicator - the QualityBit (QB) - helps to evaluate each test without time delay. This QB is automatically determined in the tool, based on the results from the tool FRA calculation as well as the FBU stabilization criteria. Run Summary Report (Memory - 'Rig Floor') An Adobe PDF document that shows general as well as specific information of each test-station performed. As TesTrak is able to perform Multiple Repeat Tests ('Optimized Test'), each test- station is represented by History plot composed of up to three tests (pressure, volume, temperature vs. time), Modulo plot (pressure vs. time) and data table. Modulo plots are intended to amplify the data part of the FBU pressures, which helps to QC the stabilization criteria for specific test. The data for modulo plots are listed in the Data LAS files.\", 'Passage_id': 1066}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-YB-3 AH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Summary Sperry's GeoTap tool was used in the section of ConocoPhillips well 2/4-YB-3AH. The data presented in this report is memory data from MWD run 700, 800 and 900. The tests in run 700 and 800 were taken while drilling. Test in run 800 had poor seal during the first drawdown. The pad was found to be damaged during the post run inspection for the run 700 tools. The same tool was used in 2/4-YB-3H and 2/4-YB-3 HT2. In run 900 tests and were taken while drilling and 3-7 while POOH. Pressure Test Classification 1. Good buildup stabilization means that the pressure is stable to within psi for the last third of the build-up, P3-P2 pressures repeat to within psia. 2. Fair buildup stabilization means that the pressure is stable to within psi for the last third of the build-up, P3-P2 pressures repeat to within psia. 3. Poor buildup stabilization means that the pressure is NOT stable to within 5psi for the third build-up, P3-P2 pressures DO Not Repeat to better than psia. 4. Low perm - Still building, genuine low mobility test (pulls down to close to zero or Smart threshold and builds so slowly that it would not reach stable pressure in anywhere close to reasonable time. 5. Tight Test, genuine very low mobility test (pulls down to close to zero or Smart threshold and builds just few 10's psi, if at all). 6. No seal means that the transient shows no drawdown evident. 7. Lost Seal means that the transient shows drawdown and possibly of build-ups proceeds to fair buildup stability and is then lost (premature return to Hydrostatic pressure).

This section was drilled with Water Based Mud (WBM). The XPT run (Run 1B) was performed to obtain formation pressures. The XPT was fitted with Large-Diameter Probe (LDP). Formation pressures were evaluated from MD to MD. The MDT run (Run 1C) was performed to obtain formation pressures, acquire formation fluid samples, and conduct Interval Pressure Transient Tests (IPTT). The MDT tool string included an Extra-Large Diameter Probe (XLD) and Saturn 3D Radial probe (Saturn) for pressure and sampling, as well as Conventional probe (STD) for Vertical Interference Testing (VIT) purposes. An InSitu Fluid Analyzer (IFA) was used for fluid identification. Formation pressures were evaluated from MD and MD. total of 12 samples were acquired during this run: two samples at MD (file no. 2), two samples at MD (file no. 9), three samples at (file no. 12), one sample at MD (file no. 3), one sample at MD (file no. 4), and three samples at MD (file no. 6). In addition fluid scanning was conducted at MD (file no. 8). Interval Pressure Transient Testing (IPTT) was conducted after sampling on all the mentioned sampling stations. Permanent datum is mean sea level. All Wireline depth measurements were referenced to the drill floor which was located 25 above mean sea level. Depths for all stations were correlated with Run 1A HRLA-PEX-ADT-GR dated 8th of November 2016. Operational Summary Noise is observed in both formation pressure and hydrostatic pressure readings during pretests, especially in Run 1C. Such noise is suspected to be caused by the movement of Wave Motion Compensator (WMC) on the rig. After the first station in Run 1C, decision was made by the driller to POOH to fix the WMC. Run commenced after this showed much less noise in pressure readings. Due to Lost Circulation Material (LCM) in the well plugging of the Saturn is seen at the beginning of some stations (file no. 6, 9, 12). This was however managed and resolved by pumping out from the interval and keeping slow pumping speed. Pretest Interpretation Summary Formation pressures were evaluated at 33 stations. In addition, pressure was evaluated after pumping at six stations. Also the VIT probe was used for pressure evaluation at five IPTT stations. Therefore total of 44 pressure tests are presented in this report. All pretests were processed and evaluated using InSitu Pro software. All probes were fitted with quartz gauge, and only data from these gauges were used for interpretation.

On the basis of the samples provided, and the wireline log, the studied section, below 2300m was divided into nine lithostratigraphical intervals as follows: Interval 1, 2125m - 2351m, consists of deepwater marine clay of Campanian age which unconformably overlies interval 2. Interval 2, 2351m - 2356m, consists of 5m of Volgian to Ryazanian deepwater anoxic sediments, mostly thinly laminated fine sands and mudstones, these lie with considerable unconformity on the high energy, marginal marine, early to mid-Bajocian coarse and fine sands of interval 3. Six distinct lithotypes were recognised in interval on the basis of their grain size and sorting characteristics. These were (a) moderately, poorly sorted silt, (b) moderately to well sorted very fine sand, (c) poorly sorted fine sand, (d) very poorly sorted medium sand, (e) moderately to well sorted coarse sand, and (f) calcite cemented sands. The sands of Interval 3, 2356m -2403m, contain gas. Interval overlies, apparently conformably over the Toarcian, silts and mudstones of interval 4. Interval 2403m - 2498m, consists of five coarsening and shallowing upwards sequences of thinly interlaminated, wave rippled and burrowed marine silts and mudstones with minor fine glauconitic sands. This overlies the interbedded coarse and fine sands of Interval 5, 2498m - 2596m. Seven distinct lithotypes were recognised in interval on the basis of their grain size and sorting characteristics. These were (a) moderately, poorly sorted silty clay, (b) moderately poorly sorted coarse silt, (c) well sorted very fine sand,*(d) moderately, poorly sorted fine sand, (e) poorly sorted medium sand, (f) moderately sorted coarse sands, and (g) calcite cemented horizons. Part of interval was cored and examination suggests deposition in shallow offshore marine environment with storm emplaced sands. The sands of the upper part of the interval contain gas. Interval is approximately dated as late Pliensbachian to early Toarcian. Interval 6, 2596m - 2616m, consists of marine, micaceous, clayey siltstone with six prominent cemented horizons.

This information has been supplemented by preliminary investigation of palynological preparations, supplied by LAP, of ditch cuttings samples over the intervals 2353m-2425m and 2617m-2795m. Following the recovery of additional biostratigraphic information, it became apparent that summary of information was required. This information therefore is summarised for each individual interval and allows the sequence investigated to be placed in its stratigraphic context. Additionally, it facilitates correlation with adjacent areas. Interval (2125r2351m). Age: Late Cretaceous, Campanian. A rich microplankton dominated assemblage was recovered from the sidewall core at 2349.00m, characterised by abundant specimens of Palaeoperidinium pyrophorum. The occurrence of Odontochitina costata and O. operculata, in association with the remainder of the assemblage, suggests Campanian age. No pre-Campanian index taxa were observed. Comparable microplankton assemblages are frequently encountered in the upper part of the Shetland Group in the Brent Province. Interval (2351:&2356m). Age: Early Cretaceous, Ryazanian - Late Jurassic, late Volgian. The ditch cuttings sample from 2353m contained no in situ taxa, palynomorphs recovered being derived, via caving, from the overlying Late Cretaceous. Correlation with the Hot Shale unit of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation is suggested by the occurrence of numerous specimens of thick-walled Tasmanites spp. and Pterospermella aureolata at 2351.80m (SWC). The simultaneous occurrence of Gochteodinia villosa is of age diagnostic value, having total range of upper middle Volgian - Ryazanian, but being more commonly encountered in sediments of late Volgian - Ryazanian age. 01/STS011', 'Passage_id': 1073}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7/11-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The cored interval, from 9943' to 9990', is the upper most part of the sandstone section.

Various possible explanations for the above mentioned scatter were investigated and the main conclusions are. 1. Correction on measured thermal conductivity due to different temperature in situ and in the laboratory can be neglected. 2. The measured variation in thermal conductivity can be correlated with variation in quartz content, and generally the range in the scatter of the plot of thermal conductivity versus water content can be explained by the actual range in quartz content (10% - 50% of the mineral fractions). 3. Samples from sites D85-N, D85-0 and D85-V were expanded due to gas release in the pores at the time when thermal conductivity was measured on board. To correct for this the measured values must be increased (a maximum effect of 16% for the data from site 085-N). 4. The average ratio between the thermal conductivities reported by S&ttem et al. (1985) and the corresponding theoretical thermal conductivities is 1.81.

However, such events are less established than the temperature history at our sites. Furthermore, as several episodes of erosion and deposition may have occurred, the summarised effect of these processes may largely be cancelled. The effect from the topographic relief and lateral variations in Quaternary sediment thickness is found to be negligable for all the heat flow sites. Thus only corrections for climatic variations are included in the present study. 6.4.3 Status of knowledge about the glacial history of the area Introduction This Chapter provides rather extensive discussion of the status regarding knowledge about the glacial history of the Barents Sea. Based on this discussion we have suggested two alternative temperature history models from the area implying maximum (model I) and minimum (model II) effect on heat flow measured in shallow boreholes (Chapter 6.4.4 and chapter 6.4.5). The Quaternary is characterised by large changes in climate with glaciations and interglaciations. Investigations in the north Atlantic (Shackleton et al. 1982) indicate that extensive ice sheets existed in the northern hemisphere about 2.4 mill BP. From then on there have been alterations between glacial and interglacial periods. The exact time for the first glaciation may, however, be disputed. Published knowledge The knowledge of how the last ice age (the Weichselian) developed and receaded in the Barents Sea are scarce compared with the western and southern part of the European ice sheet. This relation is even more pronounced going back in time to the last interglacial (the Eemian) and the preceeding glacial (the Saalian) and interglacial (the Holsteinian).

This is necessary when the surface towards which the heat flows (representing boundary condition) is at different levels and has different temperatures in short enough distances away from the site to affect the downward temperature increase (i.e. the topography causes the heat flow to deviate from the vertical). The topographic effect on temperature gradients can be estimated by an equation derived by Jeager (1965) (in Kappelmayer & Haenel 1974): where G=Gu- x .o Ti (x2 z2) G is the apparent gradient influenced by topography Gu is corrected thermal gradient in the underground x is the distance away from the site to change in annual surface temperature .6,,T0 z is the depth below the surface of the site. On land the use of this equation is relatively simple as the mean annual temperature for given region generally can be expressed as a linear function of altitude. In the sea water masses, however there may exist different sheets of water with different temperatures. Mean annual temperature difference within given water depth range at spesific geographical position is therefore influenced by 1) the depth to the bundary between different water masses, and 2) the mean annual temperatures within the actual water masses. In our case we have considered the topographic relief on all our sites (as revealed by our shallow seismic data), and for the worst case quantified what magnitude of To that is necessary to make the topographic effect significant.

The variations in paleotemperatures due to the glacial history is evaluated for the last 245 000 years. This effect is found to vary depending upon glaciation models and site locations. Maximum and minimum effects are calculated based on two glaciation models. The result of this is summarized in Table 6.4.3 and in the Table 6.6.2 below this effect is expressed as correction factor to the actual measured temperature gradient for each individual site.

Two samples from and are mudstones, while limestone occurs at and 1880 m. The bulk composition of the sandstones is summarized in Tab. 1. The Type sandstones are dominantly very fine to fine grain sized, whereas Type II sandstones are of fine to medium sand. Grains in Type sandstones are generally poorly sorted, while Type II sandstones are moderately to well sorted. Although abundant quartz overgrowths make it difficult to compare the roundness of grains, using CL it was observed that sand grains in the Type sandstones are angular to subrounded, whereas grains in the Type II sandstones are subrounded to well rounded. 3.3 MINERALOGY 3.3.1 Detrital Mineralogy Average bulk composition and framework grain mineralogy is given in Table I. Quartz (mono and polycrystalline) content varies between 40 and 60% in the Type sandstones, while it constitutes 60 to 80% of the Type II sandstones. Feldspars (dominantly K-feldspar with some plagioclase and perthite) are more abundant in the Type sandstones and form to 12% of the whole rock. Due to variable degree of their leaching, feldspars in the Type II sandstones range between and 10%. The control of leaching on feldspar content is clearly seen when very fine and medium grained samples are compared under CL. Medium grained arenites show less feldspar and more kaolinite (blue luminescence), while very fine grained wackes show more feldspar and less kaolinite. This difference can also be seen between fine and medium grained lamination with sample (e.g. in sample from m). Mica (mainly muscovite with some biotite) con- stitutes normally up to 3% of the Type sandstones, while it is rare (usually <1.5%) in the Type II sandstones. Rock fragments (dominantly volcanic with occasional quartzitic) may either be absent or up to 8.6% in both Types of sandstones. Matrix content (predominantly non-resolvable clays) varies commonly between 20 and 52% and and 5% in the Type and Type II sandstones, respectively. Although porosity is highly variable between the samples, there is generally more in the Type II sandstones. It ten020.wp 17', 'Passage_id': 1089}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7120/1-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: normally varies from to 5%, and to 6% in the Type and Type II sandstones, respectively. In few samples of the Lower Cretaceous Type II sandstones, porosity values are as high as 10%. The Upper Jurassic Type II sandstones are cleaner, more mature and generally have porosity values between 10 and 12%. 3.3.2 Authigenic Mineralogy Pyrite (framboidal and cubic crystals), clay minerals (smectite-illite, kaolinite, and chlorite), quartz overgrowths (common to extensive), and calcite (dominantly poikilotopic with some micritic-sparry) are the common authigenic phases found in the examined sandstones. Pyrite tends to be more abundant (<1 to 3%) in the Type sandstones, while it is usually rare (<1%) in the Type II sandstones. SEM studies show that smectite- illite (S/I) grain coatings are clearly more common in the Type sand- stones, whereas they are absent or rare in the Type II sandstones. In contrast to S/I, kaolinite is clearly more abundant in the Type II sand- stones. Trace amounts of glauconite, feldspar overgrowth, and chlorite were observed in few samples, mainly of Type sandstones. Pyrite and clay minerals are rare (<1%) to absent in the Upper Jurassic Type II sandstones. Quartz overgrowth is the most important authigenic phase influencing reservoir properties (discussed later) and is unambiguously more extensively developed in the Type II sandstones. It's content ranges from <1 to 4% and <1 to 12.6% in the Type and Type II sandstones, respectively. Like kaolinite and quartz overgrowth, calcite cement is also often more abundant in the Type II sandstones. It normally varies between and 2% in the Type sandstones, while due to patchy distribution calcite content in the Type II sandstones is highly variable (0 to 13%). In completely cemented Type II sandstone sample (from depth), the calcite (poikilotopic) content has been found to be 37.6%. Calcite cement is absent in the Upper Jurassic sandstones.\", 'Passage_id': 1090}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 7120/1-2 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Ma1m, 0.A., Christensen, 0.B., Fumes, H., Levlie, R., Rueslatten, H. & Ostby, K.L., 1984, The Lower Tertiary Balder Formation: An organogenic and tuffaceous deposit in the North Sea region, In: Spencer, A.M. et al.

No large scale slump or mass flow deposits were recognised. Nbst foram chambers are spar-filled and the matrix porosity has been encrusted with an organo-silica cement over micro-spar and skeletal materials. The Tor Formation is represented by white, massive and dense chalk wackestone with some dark-filled burrows. The facies is reminiscent of the Tor as seen in 2/8A-l6. Coccoliths are well preserved within the matrix, which appears to have thinner coating of crusty organo-silica than either the underlying Hod Formation (or the Tor as seen in other wells). It maybe normally deposited pelagic chalk or part of an olistostrome. The Lista Formation consists of glauconitic clays and grey clays with fish debris and radiolarians.

Initial burrowing was vague. Latest burrows are more discrete and are filled with clay. Clay-filled burrows have freguentlybeenre-burrowedbylaterburrowers (especially(1crs, but also with some Zc.xijtyrn.s and Planolites). Rare clayey seams enhance the somewhat crude banding in places. These are locally warped, but not wholly overfolded, in places (e.g. 2614.5m). In thin-section they are seen to be sparse wackestones with planktonic forams (including Glcibctruncana). Occasional clusters of forams represent faecal pellets: Lower down in the cored section (e.g. 2616m) there appears to be relatively more skeletal material (dispersed within the micritic matrix) than occurs higher up. The skeletal material includes echinoid spines, Inocerzmus fragments and benthic forams. This material could have been derived from shallower water depths (i.e. micro-turbidites). Diagenesis : Under both thin-section and SEM intraskeletal pores are seen to be largely filled with calcite spar. Rare forams contain oil. The matrix has been recrystallized to calcite microspar and minor fractures are filled with calcite spar. Clay seams have been enhanced by pressure dissolution. Under the SEM the sediment is seen to consist of microspar which contains obvious forams. However, coccoliths are not particularly well preserved, although they occur. The micro-fabric appears to be compact and well cemented. Acrusty organo-silica coating occurs on most of the fine microspar, but relatively thinly. The clay mineralogy of sample taken at 2614.4m contained only traces of kaolinite (4%), 22% illite and 74% expandable clays (as well-ordered smectitic illite-smectities).

Bare episodes of downslope creep are reflected in minor crenulation of depositional laminations, but there was no large scale mass-flow, although sommicro-turbidites were introduced. The truncation surface seen at the very top of the interval (in Core 4) may mark the erosive base of the Tor succession. SUNIARY The bulk of the Tor Formation is unseen in the cored succession. Possible Tor material occurs in the very broken core section between about 2583.8m and 2586.1m but too little remains to warrant full description. Lithology: It consists of white, massive and dense chalky wackestone with some dark filled burrows. It appears to lack clasts, but the state of the material is such that this cannot be said with certainty. Towards the base of Core wispy parallel-banded chalk occurs, the banding is depicted by thin clay seams. These are exaggerated by pressure dissolution. There are discrete clay-filled burrows but they cannot be identified. In thin-section globigerinid and rare Globotruncanid forams occur, as do spicules and radiolarians.

Top Core) SINMARY The Lista commences as green, soapy claystone with an abundance of glauconite pellets. It passes up into grey calcareous claystones that are generally biotutbated, but with some laminated beds. The top of the cored interval consists of dark grey clays with fish bones, fish scales and radiolaria. DESCRIPTION OF FORMATION The Lista is treated as one interval as follows. Lithology : At the base of the core is green and soapy claystone with black carbonaceous filaments (these have the appearance of root hairs under the binocular microscope but are almost certainly filamentous burrows with some carbonaceous debris within them). Over few cms the sediment becomes intensely glauconitic, as glauconite 'matrix' between clay filled Planolites and Chondrites burrows. Greenish clays with few, vague, dark filled burrows continue to 2580.5m, where there is an abrupt change to dark grey clays.\", 'Passage_id': 1101}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/11-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The dark grey clays have discrete burrows with glauconite pellets. The clays themselves contain fish bones, fish scales and scattered radiolarians. Diagenesis : Under the SEM the clays are seen to consist of smectites (equivalent to the expendables noted in the XRD analyses) and authigenic books of kaolinite. Other detrital clays are merely part of the fine matrix. light dusting of authigenic silica occurs, even on the edges of authigenic:kaolinite platelets. Rare coccoliths are seen. There appears to be more micro-porosity at 2582.3m than is seen lower down in the cored section. This may be more chance of sample selection and not general case. Three samples were taken for clay mineral analysis. They are all broadly comparable, having around 5% kaolinite (some of which is authigenic), 12-16% illite and 77-83% expendables. Apart from lower illite content (and concomitant increase in the content of expendables) the clay mineralogy is very similar to that observed in the Hod Formation. This is unusual, as there are often considerable differences between the Lista and Hod in other wells, reflecting marked change of provenance. There is no significant change in mineralogy at the change from light grey to dark grey clays. Porosity : No macro-porosity was seen in the Lista samples. Interpretation : Deposition took place in deep water setting and was condensed at the base of the succession, as seen in the cores. This is marked by the abundance of glauconite. The carbonate content of the grey clays is attributable to coccoliths. There is an abrupt cut-off in carbonate supply with the onset of dark grey clay deposition. The presence of fish debris and radiolarians suggests relatively rapid deepening event at the change from lighter to darker claystones.', 'Passage_id': 1102}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/11-4 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Lista Formation showing relic laminae and discrete clay-filled burrows.

Box 60 4064 Stavanger Attn.: Rodney Venn Your Ref.: Our Ref.: Date : 08.02.2001 Subject: Coring report, well 25/11-C-3 CH. 28.12.00 Security DBS started coring in the 1/2 section in well 25/11-C-3 CH, using 3/4 HDT CBBL and 1/2 core-head. One core was cut, with total recovery of 53,5 metres. We hope that ExxonMobil is satisfied with the results and the quality of the services and the core material from this job. We are looking forward to continuing our co-operation with ExxonMobil. If you have any questions or comments please contact me at tel. 51 837960. Yours faithfully for Security DBS Svein Ravndal Service Co-ordinator', 'Passage_id': 1111}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 CH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: CORE EQUIPMENT Core-head: In this job we used an FC 284 RILI core-head. This is an 8-bladed PDC core-head set with Ring Claw PDC cutters. The coring was performed with an average ROP of 30,6 m/h, and the core-head was almost as good as new after the job. Inner tubes: Fluted aluminium inner tubes were used in this job. The fluted tubes have reduced contact area to the entering core, and therefore reduce the friction and the risk of jamming the core. The fluted inner tubes will also increase safety, specially when coring in HP wells. The fluted tubes eliminate the risk of trapped gas in the core barrel as the core is tripped to surface. Any expanding gas coming out of the core will be vented along the flutes and out in the mud. The inner tubes worked as expected in this job. Telescopic Internal Lip Shoe (TILS): Telescopic shoe (TILS) was used in this core job. The TILS ensures complete sealing between the inner-tube and the core-head, and thereby prevents any mud-flow along the core entering through the core-head and the shoe. The TILS will therefore reduce the risk of washing the core, and reduce the mud filtrate invasion. CONCLUSION Overall results: Metres Cored ROP Recovery Utility of CBBL Metres recovered per run The above table shows very good results from this core-job. We recovered 53,5 metres of core in one run even though we cored through changing lithology, varying from claystone to soft sandstone. We also got high ROP of 30,6 m/h. The conclusion is very well performed job with good overall results.', 'Passage_id': 1112}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 CH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: OM Mil OM  NM NIB IIM  OM OM OM NM MI NIB MIMI 11 MO  NM lint 8111 CORING SUMMARY Core Serial CH CH CH Date Depth Mtr Rec CBBL Utility.

In order to prevent problems with 13 3/8 casing running due to smaller drift, Dog Leg Severity (DLS) requirements were reduced from /30m to /30m. This resulted in faster drilling. The average Rate Of Penetration (ROP) of 40 m/hr, is the best ROP in this section so far on Jotun. Sand contents were as high as 6% while drilling through the Utsira sand. As result of the high ROP and high sand contents, the drilling fluid became loaded with sand and high mud losses were experienced over the shakers. Indications of hole packing off were seen. The pipe was worked rotating at 100 RPM while circulating and conditioning the hole.  The 13 3/8 shoe was set at 1290 MD. Even though the casing was run in 16 hole section, no tight spots were encountered during running and no problems were experiences while cementing the casing.

The hole section was drilled with one bit run, using Anchor MI's VersaVert oil-based mud system with mud weight of sg. After drilling through the 13 3/8 casing shoe, meters of new formation was drilled and Formation Integrity Test (1,1:1) was performed to obtain an Equivalent Mud Weight (EMW) of sg. After wiper trip, wireline gyro tool was run inside the odrillpipe at 3109 MD. The gyro survey indicated difference of in horizontal displacement and in TVD. The 12 1/4 section was drilled to Target Depth (TD) of 3684 MD (2128 TVD) as picked by geologist due to lack of sand. The hole was circulated clean and flowchecked before performing wiper trip to 2100 MD. When washing down to bottom, the mud weight was reduced to sg.

Acceptable real-time log data coverage (Figure 3.1) and full memory data (Figures 3.2, 3.3) were recovered. The DRHM curve in the 1/2 hole section is consistently above zero, ranging from 0.02-0.05 g/cm3 for most of the interval, however the density log quality is considered good. The RNT resistivity curves are corrected for tool size, nominal hole size (the string lacks caliper), and mud resistivity. Corrections for di-electric properties of the formation were not made at the wellsite. The validity of these corrections in the Heimdal oil sands continues to be evaluated. The competing effect of anisotropy, particularly in the shalier intervals, remains unclear. Consequently, both uncorrected and CRIM corrected versions of the RNT data have been archived on the final tape. ORD density employed the sonic caliper for borehole and Baker-Hughes patented weighting algorithm. This algorithm minimizes the errors associated with standoff and statistical uncertainty related to count rates. Depth reference is driller's depth.

However, in populating geologic and reservoir models, it is more critical that only those sections with clear log response be used. The LITH flag, is therefore, designed as lithology input curve for constraining geologic models. Depicted in track of Figure 3.2, this was the primary flag for the volumetric summations in Table 3.4. The nature of horizontal penetration and the LWD logging tool responses require that the cutoff criteria used for both lithology flags be somewhat arbitrary. Cuttings description, drill rate, and offset well data were considered along with the collective log responses from the full suite of LWD logs in developing the assignment criteria. It is acknowledged that the criteria delineated in Table are arbitrary and that they are not similar for all Jotun horizontal penetrations.

Phi (%) Log calculations conducted at 0.1m md increments. 3.4.5 Azimuthal Gamma Ray After reaching TD, the azimuthal capability of the two-directional Baker- Hughes GR was employed in an effort to deconvolve penetration geometry. This is done by orienting the sidewall mounted scintillators to the high side and low side of the hole and relogging drilled interval while sliding (i.e. maintaining constant toolface orientation). In this application the measurements were made while pulling out of hole from 4200 to 3875m MD. Figure depicts the full interval azimuthal GR data in track with some annotated possible interpretations; the upper half of that interval is expanded in Figure 3.5. An overlay of the two GR, in conjunction with the pad orientation, can resolve whether the drill hole entered sand horizon at low or high angle (stratigraphically or by fault), and whether the sand was entered from the top or bottom in horizontal well. Where the upper and lower GR can be clearly identified to change for shale to sand (or sand to shale) at different depths, low angle stratigraphic intersection can be interpreted and the direction of sand entry or exit can be inferred. For example the data indicate stratigraphic exit at base of sand at 3925m, but an exit via the top of sand at 3995m. Resistivity horns also are indicative of low angle (i.e. stratigraphic) bed boundaries, and several are annotated in the real-time log data of Figures and 3.5. There are at least three sand/shale boundaries where the combination of azimuthal GR and resistivity are not compatible with low angle bed boundaries and where more likely high angle (faulted contact?) might be interpreted. These are labelled in Figures and 3.5, at depths of 3938m, 4095m, and 4165m respectively. For comparison, the standard GR provided in memory (solid red curve labelled GRX in Figures and 3.5, track 1) is an arithmetic average of the two pads and is acquired while the bottom-hole assembly is rotating during drilling. In real-time it is standard practice to only bring one curve to surface. There is often need to depth align the azimuthal data to the original measured while drilling curves. That has not been done for this well in these presentations.

The well was drilled to T.D. of 2517m MD within the Hordaland Formation on the 1st January, 2003. The well was drilled in 26 days from spud to T.D. The 26 conductor had been run and set on the 7th & 8th December at 479m MD (478.64mTVDRKB). This was after the directional drilling of 32 hole, using mudmotor and gyro with seawater, during the first phase of conductor pipe batch setting, on 5th December, 2002, which had been TDd at 486mMD. There was no 16 hole section in this well. On the 9th December wireline gyro survey was ran which hung up at 451mMD. On the 10th December after displacing to an oil based mud the 26 conductor was drilled out with 12 1/4 BHA with an AutoTrak and MAP MWD. The top of the cement was tagged at 451mMD within the conductor. The cement and shoe was drilled and the rathole was cleaned out and meters of new formation was drilled to 489mMD. LOT was performed to 1.53sg EMW with mud weight of 1,32sg. The 12 1/4 hole was directionally drilled and the inclination built up to 60deg sail angle at the end of the build section at 1226mMD. Section TD was reached on the 13th December, 2002 at 1728m MD. During the drilling of this section the surface system for slurrifying the cuttings was overwhelmed by the volume of cuttings generated at high rates of penetration. Accordingly the rate of penetration had to be curtailed to rate at which the Swaco equipment could cope with the cuttings generated. wiper trip was performed and overpull was noted at 979m MD and between 816 and 700m MD. These intervals were reamed clear on the 17th December, 2002 before the whole string was pulled to surface in preparation to run Baker Atlas wireline logs. The wireline log suite comprised TTRM/DSL/ORIT/XMAC-ELITE/4CAL tools. Logging commenced down to TD at 1728m MD. While logging up problem was encountered with the density caliper log. The tools were ran back down to TD and uphole logging recommenced to surface with no problems. The logging tools were pulled to surface and the caliper logs evaluated for cement volumes for the casing run. An obstruction at the 26 casing shoe was shown on the caliper log so the caliper tool was re-run over the shoe, 550  463mMD. The wireline tools were then POOH and rigged down. The 5/8 casing was run in the hole and the shoe set and cemented at 1720m MD on 20th December, 2002. After testing the casing 3/8 bit and BHA with an AutoTrak MWD system was RIH on the 22nd December. On the 23rd December, the plugs and cement and 3mMD of new formation to 1731m MD (1331.4m TVD) was drilled and LOT performed to 1.91sg EMW (the MAPS sub indicated 1.87sg) with 1.48sg mud weight. second LOT gave value of 1.83sg (1.79sg MAPS sub). After displacing the mud to 1.68sg drilling continued to 1750mMD at which depth mud losses occurred and continued while drilling to 1793mMD. Various measures were taken to curb the losses including reducing the circulation rate and pumping LCM pills with no success. Accordingly it was decided to pull out and set cement plug. After setting the cement plug, while running in hole with the drilling assembly, losses were again seen and it was required to pull out and set second cement plug; the losses were finally cured after setting second cement plug. Drilling then recommenced with no problems until 2516mMD when tendency for the hole to pack off was noted and it became difficult to continue to drill. After drilling to 2517mMD mud losses occurred which together with the packing off tendency prompted the decision to call section TD on the 31st December and to POOH to run 1/2 casing. This depth, 1722.12m TVDRKB, was significantly shallower than the original proposed depth of 1960mTVDRKB for the TD of the well. No wireline logs were run for this section of the hole.

The 32 conductor hole for the well was spudded on 6th December at 0400 hrs using seawater. The well targeted Late Oligocene sediments SW of the VFD well template, and required rapid build to 60 degrees inclination. For this reason an AutoTrak steerable tool was used. The 32 conductor section TD was 486m MD and the 26 conductor was set and cemented at 479.62m MD (478.64mTVDRKB) with an inclination of about degrees. After cementing the conductor a gyro survey was run and the tool stood up at 451m MD indicating the possible top of the cement. complete 12 1/4 BHA with an AutoTrak and MWD system was run in the hole with 12 1/4 bit on 13th December 2002. There was to be no 16 hole section in this well. The intention was to drill the entire section in one run and to then log the hole with Baker Atlas Wireline and to case the hole with 5/8 casing. Cement was tagged at 451m MD. The well was then displaced to OBM 1.32sg before the cement was drilled out. The cement and casing shoe was drilled, the rathole cleaned out and then 3m of new formation were drilled to 489mMD. LOT was performed to 1,53sg. Drilling then recommenced and steering and increasing the inclination of the well was carried out according to the DOP. Surveys were taken at each connection. The mud weight was increased in stages as the drilling progressed according to the DOP, from (11.0ppg) to (12.6ppg) at section TD. The rate of penetration had to be held back, 25  30m/hr, not due to hole conditions or steering but due to the capacity of the slurrification system; Swaco surface equipment being unable to handle such volume of cuttings for disposal. No gas was recorded over the sections reported at potential gas anomalies Level and Level respectively; 501m Md and 585m MD.

An Autotrak and MAP drilling assembly with an 3/8 drilling bit was made up and run into the hole to 1230m, where temporary halt to the operation of 12hrs was made in order to clean and organise the rig. Washing down within the casing commenced at 1661m MD and the top of the cement was tagged at 1677.5m MD. The cement shoe and rathole was drilled and then 3m of new formation was drilled to 1731m MD. The hole was circulated clean and the mud weight stabilised to 1.48SG. An extended LOT was then run as per procedure and gave value of 1.91sg (1.87sg maps sub). second extended leak off test was carried out and gave value of 1.83sg (1.79sg maps sub). The mud was displaced to 1.68sg and drilling recommenced to 1750mMD. At this depth it was determined that mud losses were occurring to the formation. The ECD over this interval averaged 1.78SG with occasional spikes to 1.82sg. Pump pressure over the interval averaged 100bar. Drilling continued to 1762.5m with losses with pump pressure reaching maximum of 120bar where WOB increased to 15m tonne and ECD reaching maximum of 1.82sg (increasing very briefly to 1.83sg) as the string was lowered to bottom after being briefly raised. After approximately 10 minutes of further circulation the pump rate was dropped to around 65bar and the ECD dropped to 1.76sg. This cut back the rate of mud loss by approximately 30%. After circulating for an hour and monitoring losses drilling resumed to 1790m MD. Over the next three metres, to 1893m MD the WOB was increased to maximum of 13m tonnes and the ECD maximised at 1.82sg. From this point the rate of loss accelerated, increasing by approximately 100%(according to the change of slope on the active pit graph) i.e. 20% returns. The flow rate was reduced to 420 lpm with no losses and the well monitored on the trip tank with no static losses. It was decided to pump LCM pills to try and cure losses. These two pills, one at 1773m MD and the other at 1660m MD, did not seem to help and it was decided to come out to set cement plug with an open ended drill pipe string down to 1792m MD. cement plug was set on Christmas day.

Some 4 drillpipe was picked up and the mud weight was lowered to sg in order to lower the ECD and to help in curing the problem of mud losses. The assembly was washed down from 1511m MD to 1570m MD and firm cement was tagged at 1557 mD, some 160 inside casing! The cement was moderately hard and drilled at around 25 m/hr. Drilled cement outside the shoe but with 100% formation in the cuttings samples from 1745 mMD. Surveys indicated that the new hole was following the old hole but new formation was drilled from 1793m MD. There were no losses and the hole cleaning was good and the cuttings quality was excellent. The ECD was 1.66sg. Limestone stringers were drilled at 2026m MD, 2127m MD and 2260m MD which slowed drilling rates but there were no cavings or hole instability problems. By 2516mMD the mud weight had been increased to 1.69sg (ECD 1.74sg). The Mid Miocene Marker (T150) was identified from logs at 2139mMD (1534mTVD). The Early Miocene marker (T120) was identified from logs at 2434mMD (1680mTVD). At 2516m MD the hole showed a tendency to pack off and it was difficult to continue to drill ahead. The drilling parameters were varied and further meter was drilled when again the hole packed off and loss of plus cubic metres of mud occurred. The hole was still difficult, so it was decided to call section TD at 2517mMD and to POOH to run 1/2 casing. MWD Run No : 1720  2517mMD : Section TD, hole packing off.

Completion The well 34/7-C-4 T2H is the drilled and completed by Saga with the SSDR Bideford Dolphin from June to November 1999. It is the 4th and last well on template C, drilled to total depth of 4220 m MD (2449.3 TVD). The primary objective of the completion operations was to complete the well as an Upper Brent (Tarbert Fm) oil producer in Vigdis Middle. The completion solution is 1/2 tapered tubing string was installed in 10 3/4 % casing. The well was perforated in overbalance with drill pipe before installation of the completion string. 718 long interval in the Tarbert Fm, Upper Brent Gp, was perforated. Both the and the liner was perforated. (For details, see Figure 5.1: Completion well schematic) 5.1 Wellhead system The wellhead system is based on standard 18 3/4, 690 bar, ABB Vetco Gray SG-5 system. 5.2 Tubing hanger system An ABB Vetco Gray type tubing hanger is installed, having nominal production bore, nominal annulus bore and working pressure of 345 bar. Both bores are equipped with nipple profile for tubing hanger plug. Three connections in the tubing hanger are provided for connecting to two hydraulic control lines (hydraulic stab) and one electrical line (wet connector). hydraulic control line for TRSCSSV and electrical line for downhole pressure and temperature gauge are installed in this well. 5.3 Subsea tree An ABB Vetco Gray type subsea tree is installed, having bore and working pressure of 345 bar. The subsea tree comprises an 18 3/4 690 bar MD-H4 connector to lock and seal it to the SG-5 wellhead. Stab subs, hydraulic stabs and electrical wet connector on the subsea tree connect, respectively the production bore, annulus bore, TRSCSSV and downhole pressure and temperature gauge to the tubing hanger. Production flow is routed from the choke on the subsea tree, through flowline spool and connector on the lower half of the subsea tree frame, and to the manifold pipework. The choke is bolted to the wing block. It features retrievable actuator, which is accessed via the upper subsea tree frame. The gate valves are hydraulic failclose safety valves rated to 345 bar, with actuators incorporating visual position indicators, except the swab valves, which are manually operated. The subsea tree control pod is retrievable device and is mounted on the opposite side of the choke. The control pod receives hydraulic supply from the manifold structure via the tlowline connector interface. Electric supply and control signals are also routed via the manifold, but connected to the top of the control module with ROV.

RESERVOIR 6.1 Reservoir Geology The oil producer 34/7-C-4 T2H, is located in Vigdis Middle, target is about 0,4 km north-east of exploration well 34/7-19 (Figure 6.1). According to the plan the well penetrated only the Tarbert Fm. of the Brent Gp. The top of the Brent Group was penetrated at 3423 MD RKB/2423 TVD MSL, approximately metres TVD deeper than prognosed, in the heal while it was penetrated approximately 13 metres TVD shallower than prognosed in the toe, i.e. at 4140 MD RKB/2424 TVD MSL. The upper part of the reservoir unit consists of argillaceous, fine grained, occasionally very fine and medium grained, sandstone interbedded with sandy shale stringers. The shale stringers become less abundant towards the top of the unit. The sorting is moderate with subrounded to subangular grains grading to well sorted subangular to angular grains towards the top. The degree of consolidation is generally poor to moderate except some carbonate cemented intervals in the upper part of the unit. The visual porosity is poor. Shows were seen throughout the upper part of the section. Below 3705 (2432 TVD MSL) the reservoir unit mainly consists of very fine to fine grained argillaceous sandstone. The sandstone is well sorted with subangular to subrounded grains. It is commonly loose to friable and occasionally firm due to carbonate cementation. The visual porosity is poor. Shows were seen throughout the sandstone section. A geological cross section along the wellpath is shown in Figure 6.2. Depths and thicknesses are listed in Table 6.1. Note that the calculation of the isochore and isopach thicknesses are highly dependent on the dip of the layers due to high well inclination through the Brent Gp. An average structural dip of 3/210 was used for the Brent Group.

The seismic source employed for the N.I. survey was two sleeve guns with total volume of 300 cu.ins, depth and air pressure of 2000 psi. The following levels were recorded (m MD RKB) Run 1, NI Run 2, NI Level spacing 10 10 In total, 278 levels were recorded of which 269 levels were included in the VSP processing and check shot computation. A composite display consisting of VSP upgoing wavefield spliced into surface seismic (SG9701) is shown in Figure 6.3. The tie between the VSP and the seismic is good. Synthetic Seismogram READ has applied check shot calibrated velocity logs and density logs from the well to generate synthetic seismograms. zero phase version of synthetic seismogram as well as sonic, density and impedance logs are displayed together with surface seismic random line from SG970I along the well path in Figure 6.4. Map updating The well penetrated the base Cretaceous unconformity and the top of the Brent reservoir deeper than prognosed. The BCU in the toe of the well was penetrated approximately 13 shallower than prognosed. The Charisma picks of the interpretations are confirmed by the check shot values within range of milliseconds. Figures illustrate the interpretation along the well. No adjustments have been done to the time interpretation of the reflectors. The well results are integrated in the new depth grids based on interpretation of the SG9701 survey. A summary of formation tops, co-ordinates, and seismic positions is given in Table 6.2.

Corrections for di-electric properties of the formation were not made at the wellsite. The validity of these corrections in the Heimdal oil sands remains unclear. The competing effect of anisotropy, particularly in the shale intervals, cannot be resolved. Both uncorrected and CRIM corrected versions of the RNT data have been archived on the final tape. ORD density employed the sonic caliper for borehole and Baker-Hughes patented weighting algorithm. This algorithm minimizes the errors associated with standoff and statistical uncertainty related to count rates. The Pathfinder CLLS tool was set to 16 second wave updates in group firing mode. A delay of 28 hours was set in the tool to insure data collection all the way to TD. As run ended with washout, this delay was never an issue. Post-well processing was not required as the wellsite DT data were of high quality. Depth reference (MWD survey) was adjusted after the well was drilled in accordance with gyro survey taken at TD in 25/11-C-3EH. The well survey in the original well and the sidetrack has been tied to this gyro. The gyro results in 4.5m shallower TVD in the C3EH location than was originally reported by the MWD survey and 1m change in the TVD at the point of the sidetrack. BOTH the original survey and the gyro-corrected survey are documented in Appendix of this report and in section of the Baker Hughes final well report. The Definitive listings in that report incorporate the gyro, the BHI AutoTrak listings that follow do not. This decision is not forced by any well observations or hard data, but given the purported superiority of the gyro and no apparent reason to suspect it, the gyro was used.

Although shale volume was not determined directly (see next section), the GR was used to net reservoir (along with resistivity and neutron-density separation), and sand so identified was subjected to total porosity and total water saturation determination in sequence. The following sections detail the steps employed in the determinations. At the end of the sections for net sand, total porosity, and log-based water saturation, Table 3.7 lists all the parameter assignments required in analyzing the log data. The input log curves are plotted over the entire sand-bearing Eocene and Paleocene section in Figure 3.1. They are joined by calculated curve data over the gas and oil reservoir sections in Figure in MD and the same data are plotted in Figure in TVD depth scale. 3.4.1 Net Sand Standard shale volume calculations employing shale and clean GR and/or density- neutron separation have not been attempted. The presence of thin beds, non- dispersed shale (as clasts), and other mineralogical complexity, such tuffaceous sands, has been judged to limit the effectiveness of such data in distinguishing sand from shale. The decision to forego standard shale volume assessment requires that some other method of netting sand from shale be established. To this end, netting flag has been constructed for the 25/11-C-3EH well. Gamma Ray, resistivity, and density- neutron separation are used as three separate cutoff to assign every 0.1m md increment as either sand or shale. In intervals where overall log character and cuttings description indicate significant tuff occurrence (3060-3080m MD in the Balder III-1 section), the GR cutoff was adjusted lowered to effectively preclude this section from being flagged as sand. bulk density (BDCM) flag (defined to match 18% total porosity) is applied to all interval assigned by the GR cutoff as sand to distinguish reservoir sand from cemented sand and/or limestone. In this - 16 -', 'Passage_id': 1147}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 EH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: well, this non-reservoir sand flag did not flag appreciable carbonate-cemented sand or siltstone section. The primary objective of this flag is to provide an acceptable count of net sand interval penetrated in the wellbore. It is hoped that the cutoffs will identify equal amounts of the sand and shale in the section(s) effected by bed boundaries. The sand and reservoir flags in Figure record this flag for the 25/11-C-3CH well. These same flags were employed for reservoir summation (section 3.4.4). 3.4.2 Total Porosity Total porosity is determined from the density log assuming matrix density of g/cc. RHOFL is set to in intervals of the wells known to be in the water leg; reduced fluid density values are used in the oil legs (see table 3.7). For the density determination: PHIT = (RHOMA- BDCM) / (RHOMA  RHOFL) The log density is calibrated assuming gauge hole and using standard spine and ribs algorithms. There is no confirmation of gauge hole. As noted in the log quality section there is modest difference between the near and far detector calculated density (DSAM and DLAM). It is most likely that this is imparting slightly lower bulk density (BDCM) and correspondingly lower PHID. The sands above 2975 show density-neutron response suggestive of gas and they fall above the field GOC. To more accurately assess total porosity in these sands, the neutron-density square-root method was applied. After adjusting neutron porosity to sandstone matrix and fraction (NPLF): The calculated porosity in the gas sands seems unrealistically high. There is no meaningful calibration process to adjust them with confidence, so they are left high, but considered suspect. 3.4.3 Log-Based Water Saturation Unlike the horizontal producers where anisotropy and other factors limits Rt assessments, the modest angle of penetration in this observation well should allow meaningful resistivity-based evaluation of water saturation. In deference to the fact that the deepest attenuation curve (RACL) can be most effected by errors in di- electric assessment, particularly as resistivity increases in the oil sand interval, the deeper of the phase curves (RPCL) was used for Rt. The use of this curve is also supported by the fact that RPCL tracks very well with RACH throughout the interval and also with RPCH, except where that shallower curve is clearly more effected by polarization horns. RACL, on the other hand is systematically lower than all other curves. This is interpreted to be product of either di-electric effect that has not been accounted for by the decision to forego Crim correction, or due to anisotropy. - 17 -', 'Passage_id': 1148}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 EH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Table Reservoir Summary by Zone, Well 25/11-C-3EH [Measured Depth] Zone Top-Base MD Gross (m) Net Sand/ net resv.(m) Net/ Gross Avg.

The overlain curves are plotted to converge to 100% SW at 1760TVDss using the MWD survey (i.e. they are not gyro corrected). The curves would both be lowered by approximately 4m TVD to converge to 100% SW at the solid green lines in both plots when the gyro depths are accepted. It is noteworthy that the Eocene III-2 penetrations elsewhere at Balder are more typically represented by the lower quality, higher Swirr, height function (the blue curve in Figures and 3.3). Here, the upper section of the massive sand seems best fit by the higher quality curve, with Swirr significantly less than 10%. The resistivity in this interval exceeds 60 ohmm. At face value, one could use this data, and the decrease in calculated SW with depth in the III-2 sand, to support higher FWL, either due to absolute depth inaccuracy in the survey, or to water encroachment in response to production. However, the lower portion of this sand does show modest GR increase and clear porosity decrease. At this point it is considered more likely that the lower part of the sand carries deteriorating reservoir quality and higher original Swirr. 3.5 Petrophysical Interpretation (25/11-C-3FH, Horizontal Producer) The 25/11-C-3FH was drilled to enter the III-2 sand from the flank and base (Figure 1.4). The overall sand penetrated in that section exceeded expectations and the amount of sand penetrated in the 12.25 high angle approach also exceeded expectations. The presence of definable GOC in the middle of large sand section penetrated at 82 degrees led to the running of base-line RST log after the well had been completed. - 19 -', 'Passage_id': 1149}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 EH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: It is interpreted that the significant TVD thickness of sand in the 12.25 interval is not representative of stratigraphic thickness. Rather, the well is thought to be drilled along dip in relatively thin and possibly discordant injection sand. The sand has not been assigned to any particular Eocene unit, however the presence of significant tuff both above and below suggests it is most likely III-2 or III-1 sand. Given the highly deviated reservoir penetration in the 12.25 and the horizontal character of the production section, and due to restrictions of the LWD logging program, efforts to quantify petrophysical parameters have been limited in scope. The log responses in both the of the Balder units and in the 8.5 Zone III-2 sand completion are employed to generate lithology flags. Bulk density is used to estimate porosity. Shale volumes was not calculated, as intermediate log response readings are as likely to reflect bed boundaries as they are lower reservoir quality. Resistivity logs are employed in qualitative evaluation, however are not judged accurate enough to allow assignment of Rt and quantitative water saturation determination. They do permit unambiguous assessment of the GOC, which is further confirmed by the RST. The following sections define the sand/shale/carbonate criteria for netting, the porosity determination, and the summation of net and porosity for certain intervals. A measured depth log combining both sections is depicted in Figure along with net sand and reservoir flags and calculated porosity. more detailed plot of the 12.25 section (Figure 3.5) highlights the GOC, and Figure shows the completion sands. Cuttings sand and tuff percentages are added in the far right track of each plot and overlain with curve depicting the wellbore trajectory in TVDss. 1:1000 scale MD log is attached in the Appendix section. 3.5.1 Net Sand dispersed shale (as clasts), and other mineralogical complexity, such as tuffaceous sands in the Balder Formation, limits the effectiveness of such data in distinguishing sand from shale. These problems are magnified by the high penetration angle. method of distinguishing sand and shale be established. To this end, two netting flags have been employed. The first employs gamma ray, resistivity, and density- neutron separation to assign every 0.1m md increment as either sand or non- reservoir, and bulk density cutoff to identify tight, cemented sand or limestone. The flags generated in this manner are called SANDFLAG and RESFLAG and are shown in the middle track of Figure 3.4. A second flag, called LITH, is designed to only assign lithology call if the collective log response is definitive. The idea is that in deviated well and in thin- bedded section, there can be appreciable interval in which the opposing sides of the wellbore may see different rock type. Under these conditions, the log response will be effected by both shale and sand such that definitive analysis will be difficult. Propagation resistivity horns, and averaged density and gamma ray data will not - 20 -', 'Passage_id': 1150}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 EH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: allow for unequivocal identity of net sand. The LITH flag is plotted as curve in the middle of Figures to 3.6. The log criteria employed in the assignment of SANDFLAG and RESFLAG are listed in Table 3.9. Due to the nature of LWD data and high angle penetrations some of the cutoff criteria are arbitrary and well/zone specific. The objective of the first flags (SANDFLAG and RESFLAG) is to provide an acceptable count of net sand penetrated in the wellbore. It is hoped that the cutoffs will identify equal amounts of interval effected by bed boundaries in sand and shale. The absolute location of all sands and shales is of lesser importance. However, in populating geologic and reservoir models, it may be more critical that only those sections with clear log response be used. The LITH flag, is therefore, designed as lithology input curve for constraining geologic models. - 21 -', 'Passage_id': 1151}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 EH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: 3.5.2 Porosity Total porosity in the oil leg has been determined from the density log: In the hydrocarbon interval rhofl has been set to g/cc, assuming significant reservoir oil and oil-base mud filtrate within the investigated region. The interval from 4216-4226 is interpreted to be in the lower meters of the Transition Zone with appreciably more water. As result an intermediate RHOFL of is assigned to this interval. In the water leg, it has been assumed that minimal oil-dense filtrate has invaded and rhofl has been set to g/cc. In the gas sands in part of the 12.25 section, the neutron log has also been implicated and the Square Root Rule applied: Where density and neutron porosity values are calculated on equivalent matrix. The log density is calibrated assuming gauge 8.5 hole and using Baker-Hughes standard spine and ribs algorithm. There is no quantitative confirmation from other data in this well. The porosity values in the oil leg seem high, but, at present, the density porosity values obtained from this log are considered credible and have been judged as acceptable input to geologic modeling. 3.5.3 Fluid Saturation Given the deviation of the wellbore in the hydrocarbon interval and the thin character of the oil sand, no direct calculation of fluid saturation has been undertaken. The resistivity levels and the nature of the neutron-density separation do suggest fairly high quality (low SWirr) sands in the production interval. It is not clear from the data whether the apparent change from higher quality to lower quality facies that may be present in the fully penetrated C-3EH pilot is also present here. It may be that the horizontal producer did not penetrate deeply enough in the sand to encounter the lower porosity, lower resistivity facies seen in that well. 3.5.4 Reservoir Summation Volumetric summation of net reservoir sand and average porosity was conducted for the gas and oil legs in both hole sizes. However, given the uncertain TVD to TST correlation in the highly deviated section, no effort was made to convert to TVD even over the interval with considerable vertical section Netting criteria and porosity calculations are described in previous sections and in Table 3.10. Top and base depths are reported in measured depth. - 23 -', 'Passage_id': 1152}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 EH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Table Reservoir Summary by Zone, Well 25/11-C-3FH (SANDFLAG) Zone Hole size Top MD Base MD Total Thkns. mMD Net sand mMD Net Res. mMD Avg.

Much of the interval recorded LWD bulk density below g/cm3 and yielded hydrocarbon adjusted density porosity values exceeding 38%. Log quality assessment criteria indicate no direct reason to suspect the data, but it is higher than other Eocene sand penetrations. 3.5.5 Azimuthal Gamma Ray After reaching TD, the final 100m or so of III-2 sand penetration was subjected to azimuthal Gamma Ray measurement using the two-directional Baker-Hughes GR in an effort to deconvolve penetration geometry. This is done by orienting the sidewall mounted scintillators to the high side and low side of the hole and relogging drilled interval while sliding (i.e. maintaining constant toolface orientation). In this application the measurements were made while pulling out of hole. Data were collected from 3335m MD to TD in an effort to evaluate the geometry of exit. The azimuthal pass is about 3m off depth with the original GR data. The up and down GR are plotted in Figure 3.6. The scattered response from 3330 to 3410 suggest bed boundary effect where the wellbore is passing in and out of sand/shale. The final exit from sand at 3423 appears to be at high angle as the top and bottom GR exit the sand at the sand depth. This seems supported by the lack of polarization horn in the resistivity data and by sharper sand -shale log response changes in the density-neutron. Two possible explanations: 1) fault exit to the sand 2) the final sand (from 3405-3423) is an injection sand and is injected at relatively high angle Reservoir Saturation Tool (Cased Hole PNC) Given the excellent exposure to clearly defined GOC in the 12.25 cased section of the well, Schlumberger RST log was run to obtain base-line log should later monitoring of GOC movement become necessary. main pass and two short repeats indicated extremely reliable repeatability and the passes were not averaged. SIGM and SIGM-repeat are overlain in middle track of Figure to demonstrate excellent overlay. As result, the main pass was used directly in subsequent interpretation. Depth alignment with LWD is also excellent (note GR overlay in track of Figure 3.6). - 24 -', 'Passage_id': 1153}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 25/11-C-3 EH \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The job ran smoothly, employing WellTec tractor for conveyance. The tool slid on its own until the wellbore angle reached about 70 degrees. The entire job, from start to finish, took only 11 hours. All the major gas to oil tools from the RST clearly distinguish gas from oil in the porous sands. Referring to Figure 3.7:  SIGM is about 10 C.U. in the porous gas sands, it is about 13 C.U. in the porous oil sands. This is huge difference, C.U. should be decipherable in time-lapse comparison.  TPHI (the RST equivalent of neutron porosity) varies from 15% in the gas sands to over 35% in the oil sands. Again, huge and measurable difference. It is true that the LWD neutron data do not overlay well with the RST and this difference does not seem to reflect OBM invasion, but think this is probably due to the double casing in the well and that the RST TPHI should respond similarly next time.  WINR, TRAT, and IRAT (various near/far count ratios from the tool and all known gas indicators) all spike nicely in the known gas and do not in the known oil. think they will also all work as monitor measurements. Referring to Figure 3.7: The sand at 2360m MD was interpreted to contain the GOC right near its top from the LWD data. That sand shows primarily oil signature to the RST logs. It appears that the TPHI curve is deflecting lower at the very top of this sand, but all other monitor measurements do not register gas. interpret that the LWD did have better bed resolution (due to strings of casing effecting RST) to detect thin gas at top of this sand. Therefore, believe it is reasonable to place the current GOC right at the top of this sand. If true, this 2m thick sand will provide an excellent future location to monitor any downward movement of the contact. Deeper sands will continue to be in the oil leg and provide excellent base-line oil responses. There is no current evidence of gas in the annulus of the well. Fluid there is likely dominated by heavy oil-based muds. Future RST jobs may have to deal with annulus gas. If gas gets there it will be hard to remove.

The well was secured/plugged back and 5/8 casing was removed to 178 ft below 13 3/8 casing. The well was sidedrilled with 12 1/4 bit below 13 3/8 casing shoe and drilled to top of Ekofisk formation. 7/8 5/8 casing was run to isolate overburden. 1/2 hole was drilled through pay section and cased with liner/scab-liner. The well was completed with 4 1/2 tubing. Estimated time to drill and complete well - 86 days. Actual time to drill and complete well- 70 days. total downtime recorded in this well was hrs - days. Major Engineering and operational achievements: Drilled and completed well 16 days earlier than estimated. Drilled and underreamed the 12 1/4 hole section to +/- 14 from 9900 ft to 10387 ft in one operation. Significant deviations from planned program: Due to sticky hole conditions two of the six logging runs in reservoir were canceled.

Managed to establish circulation through cut and displaced the hole with ppg kill mud. Pulled total of 187 joint of 1/2 tubing without overpull. The hole was secured with an EZSV mechanical packer at 5800'. The planned setting depth for this packer was 7090'. The deviation from original drilling program was made due to no injectivity obtained prior to the packer run. So no need was seen to set it deep. 500' long cement plug was set above the EZSV-packer and up to 5300'. By doing this it enabled us to cover the liner top at 5512' with cement.

Had bad luck and milled inside casing and damaged stabilizer above casing mill before noted. The blades on stabilizer had been cut off in bigger pieces (one foot long) and resulted in four clean up trips. Judged by the wear pattern on the junk mill, it showed centralized casing. The geolograph did not indicate when mill started going inside casing, but the torque was more erratic than before. The milling rate went down from 18 ft/hr to 10 ft/hr.

Left 1405 ft of assembly in hole, TOF at 1931 ft. Went in hole with open ended dp and screwed into and recovered fish. Threads on pin end were galled. Due to severe erratic torque build ups in combination with the use of - dp with low make up torque, the string backed out at 1931 ft. In addition, several connections were more or less un-screwed when inspected later. Some box ends were trumpet shaped. After this incident grade dp was used instead of grade dp.

Total time to drill and case 12 1/4 hole was 21 days. Total downtime recorded to drill and case 12 1/4 hole was hrs. The 1/2 Penetrator PDM motor performed very well. The Target steerable underreaming motor (SUMO) drilled and underreamed the hole to 13.4. Extend the use of Hughes ATM-G3 bit to substitute the use of ATM-11.

Further use of The Target steerable underreaming motor system is recommended if directional control and hole sizes of 14-15 are wanted. The 12 1/4 hole section was drilled without major problems and drilled formation with an average ROP of ft/hr. The formation was drilled with a steady mudweight of ppg, and new low PH drill-thin/Drispac Plus system was used. Had at some stage major difficulties with gel strength and yield point build ups and resulted in high daily mud cost. The motor on the top drive broke down when approaching top Ekofisk, and', 'Passage_id': 1169}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-A-13 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: required to drill the rest with PDM motor. The motor on top drive needed to be changed out and took 40 hrs to do. 9 1/2 Penetrator motor: The hole was kicked off with 1/2 high torque - low speed Penetrator PDM motor with deg. bent housing. The 12 1/4 hole was drilled from 4032 ft to 9243 ft. The assembly was pulled due to indications of dulled bit. Had total of 136 hrs drilling and circulation on motor. The motor performed very well without any problems. Hughes 12 1/4 ATM- G3, milled tooth bit: The bit was used in the kick off phase and the intention was to drill to underreaming depth. The bit had to be pulled 657 ft above the planned depth due to reduction in ROP. Later it was proved that the formation was becoming harder. The bit drilled total of 5211 ft, 120 hrs, approx. 1,035,000 bit revolutions. Average ROP ft/hr. Bit grading: 3-3-WT-A-5-I-NO-BC. The bit cost is 1/3 of the known Hughes ATM-11 with more or less similar performance. The bit has proved in different wells that it is capable of drilling all the different formation types seen in overburden. My recommendation is to use the ATM-G3 bit instead of the ATM-11 bit. For further reference look at the following wells: 2/4C-14B, 2/4K-18, 2/4C-21, 2/4D-07B. Kick off plug: A kick off plug was set from casing stub at 4200 ft and TOC at 3444 ft. cement volume equal to 20 hole size and 100% excess in open hole was pumped to make sure that open hole was filled with cement. 1/2 cement stinger with centralizers and scratchers were used to clean up hole prior to start cementing. In the end of the 1/2 cement stinger jet sub with sideports was used to avoid diverting flow downwards and less mixing. The cement top was hit almost 600 ft high. Drilled cement for 10 hrs to reach 13 3/8 casing shoe. think in general it should not be necessary to pump cement volume based on 20 open hole size plus 100% excess. In the past it has been standard practice to pump cement volume based on 12 1/4 hole size plus 100% excess in open hole. In addition pump volume equal to 200 ft of cement inside 13 3/8 casing. The problems that have been seen up until now have not been the cement volume but the hardness of the cement plug. Recently, the cement stinger was changed from', 'Passage_id': 1170}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-A-13 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: a 7/8 size to 1/2 tubing. The cleaning ability is improved and less contamination between cement and formation should enable better quality cement plug. Based on this the old practice should still be valid. Target Drilling Services' steerable underreaming motor system (SUMO): As part of an attempt to drill and underream lower part of 12 1/4 hole section in one operation, the Target Drilling Products' steerable underreaming motor assembly (SUMO) was used. The assembly consisted of a 12 1/4 bit followed by slick 1/2 penetrator motor with degree, 10 1/2 OD expanded bent housing with 40 PDC cutters attached to it. (It was low speed high torque motor). The motor was followed by an Andergauge variable blade stabilizer (11 3/4 - 12 1/4). When rotated the bent housing created conical cutting surface that went from 12 1/2 OD to 14 OD. On the bent housing 40 PDC cutters were attached in two rows. In addition two nozzles (10/32) were included between the two rows of PDC cutters for cleaning and cooling purposes. The assembly went in at 9900' (100' above Balder) and finished at 10387' (mid Lista). The section was drilled with relatively low penetration rate - 12.6 ft/hr due to hard formation. Various weights on bit and rotary speeds were used and as the parameters were changed to optimize the progress, drilling torque, ROP and pump pressure were monitored. The weight on bit varied from - 30 Klbs with optimum weight at 20-25 klbs. RPM on string varied from 90 - 135 (that was maximum RPM for top drive). The rotary torque values varied from amps, but most common value was 450- 500 amps. An increase in cuttings over the shale shakers were seen during drilling. The size of the cuttings was observed to be of different characteristics i.e. partially rockbit cut and PDC cut. Hole angle had building tendency of deg./100 ft, but azimuth was consistent. Ten feet were oriented 180 deg. from highside of hole direction. Approx. deg. drop was encountered, indicating deg dogleg capability per 100 feet. The motor was picked up and underreamed through the ten feet oriented hole. The Andergauge variable blade stabilizer was used to ensure the BHA to pass through smaller ID's. The stabilizer was set in 12 1/4 position when drilling and reaming to give more force (sideforce) to the PDC cutters. The motor assembly was evaluated after POOH both on the rig and onshore. The PDC cutters on housing were 0-30% worn, but 70 -75% of the cutters were chipped. Twenty cutters suffered from damaged on the face which consist of mm thick PDC layer mounted on tungsten carbide stud. This damage is primarily not from normal drilling wear, but the cutters seem\", 'Passage_id': 1171}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-A-13 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: to have taken lot of vibrations and thereby been chipped. A caliper log was run and showed an oval shape hole with minimum OD of 13 and maximum OD of 14.5, average OD equal to 13.4. The orientation device on caliper log stopped working so no highside/lowside measurement were recorded. A 12 1/4 , M1S - Smith insert bit was used together with the SUMO assembly and drilled 487 ft, hrs, approx. 550,000 revolutions and 13graded 2-2-NO-A-6-I-NO-TD. As can be seen from the bit grading the bearing was in poor condition and the most likely reason for this must be the extra sideforce that is acting from the degree bent housing. In order to get the SUMO assembly to make bigger hole the following is recommended: - Increase the OD of the bent housing by 1/8 - 1/4. This will increase the sideforce and hence make bigger hole. - Increase the amount/density of PDC cutters by 25-40% in the most exposed area. Also add 4-6 cutters on top of each row. In that manner the wear on each PDC cutter should be less. - Increase the junk slot area between the two rows cutters without changing critical dimensions, help preventing balling tendencies. - Install the tungsten carbide nozzle with an angle of 15-20 deg. backwards in order to give better mud impulse in between the rows. - The two rows of cutters will be tilted just enough to overlap the bottom cutter on one row with the top cutter on the other row. This will eliminate the stop-go movement and prevent the chipping observed on some of the cutters. By having this overlap the sideforce will be applied more evenly and reduce the tendency to drill an oval hole. - Install impact arrestors behind cutters to protect the cutters and also the casing/downhole equipment running in and out of hole. This protection will counteract the tendency to erode the hole on low side and reduce ovality of hole. 9 7/8 cement job: During displacement of cement it was left bbls cement out of 87 bbls cement inside 7/8 casing. hrs were spent to drill out cement down to FC. The Halliburton cement unit was used to displace with. The cement was displaced with the theoretical displacement volume.', 'Passage_id': 1172}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-A-13 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: The return was taken to separate pit. To be able to bump the plug it is important to take into account the air in mud that is used to displace with, the temperature change in the mud and also the pump efficiency. To calculate volume to overdisplace with is difficult, but typical number experienced is 6-7% of theoretical displacement volume. DRILL 1/2 SECTION OBJECTIVE: Drill through Ekofisk and Tor formation without going stuck, case and prepare well for completion. CONCLUSIONS: Reed Tool Co. - insert roller cone bit EHP51AJS performed very well. Spent 76 hrs in fishing after stuck logging tools. Schlumberger Enerjet perforation tool failed two times during perforation operation. DISCUSSION: The 1/2 section was drilled and cased without major problems, but had major difficulties in performing OH-logging. Went stuck two times in Ekofisk formation. Had mud losses varying from bpm to bpm during logging and running liner. Managed to control losses by pumping OM-seal pills. Reed - insert bit, EHP51AJS: The reservoir section was drilled with insert roller cone bit from Reed Tool Co. The bit performed well and drilled to TD. total distance of 1050 ft plus 939 ft of cement was drilled. Average ROP ft/hr (formation). The bit had no visual wear and bearings in good condition.

When performing the third run the tool went stuck in Ekofisk formation. The logging run consisted of EPT/PCD/MSFL/GR/AMS. It was decided to strip over logging cable. It was spent 48 hrs to recover fish. After clean up trip new logging attempt was made and consisted of RFT/GR/AMS. Went stuck in Ekofisk formation after taken RFT points. Decided to strip over cable and recover fish. Spent 28 hrs recovering fish. The rest of the logging program was canceled. Cased hole logging: The planned cased hole logging program consisted of one run. Tools included were CBL/VDL/GR/QSST. Due to poor data quality from QSST the interval had to be relogged with SAT tool. Spent hrs to re-log formation. Perforating: Had two misfires with the Schlumberger enerjet perforation gun on two separate runs. The first misfire happened in the 2nd run where just one of two shots went off. The selectivity of the two guns is obtained by the use of a dual diode plug, through which the bottom gun is fired on positive polarity and the top gun is fired on negative polarity. This switch sits at the top of the two guns below the firing head. On the misfired gun no visual damage was seen on the wiring around the detonator #1, which had not fired, however the long lead from the switch down to the detonator could have been damaged when running in. The misfire of the bottom gun seemed to be caused by short i.e the life wire is broken or improperly spliced to the detonator so that the current from surface through the life wire shorts through the fluid and onto the gun chassis instead of setting off the detonator. The second misfire happened in the 5th run where the detonator went off and set off the primacord but this did not set off the charges (but one). The charges were the same as run on the 2nd run.', 'Passage_id': 1174}, {'prompt': '\\nWELLBORE NAME: 2/4-A-13 A \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: DOWN TIME/TROUBLE TIME ANALYSIS: A total of hrs (16.4% of total hrs spent in this well) trouble time were recorded in this well.

Objectives and Results The main objective of Well 30/9-B-38 was to improve drainage and accelerate oil production from Upper Ness (UN1 zone) and Lower Ness 3-5 (LN3-5 zone) in the western part of the Gamma South structure (Figure A-1). secondary objective was to evaluate the potential of the ORENL2 reservoir in the toe section. The objectives were achived. Operations Summary Reentry operations on Well 30/9-B-38 started on the 31st of January 2000. pack stock was set in the pre-installed 95/8 casing of B-38, and B-38 was kicked off by milling window in the casing in the interval 2 MD. The well was kicked off in the Shetland Group, and an 81/2 hole was drilled into the Ness Formation and landed according to the plan. Due to unexpected pressure build-up, the formation was exposed to an ECD of max sg, and return was lost as result of fractured formation. Several attempts to heal lost circulation were performed without success. TD for B-38 was set 5831 MD / 2678 TVD, and the hole was plugged back for subsequent sidetrack. B-38 AT2 was kicked off in the Shetland Group at 4674 MD / 2515 TVD on the 21st of February 2000. The 81/2 hole was drilled into the Heather Formation at 5293 MD / 2613 TVD, reached on the 25th of February. The string packed off and stalled out at several depths, and due to severe hole stability problems the hole was plugged back on the 2nd of March 2000 for subsequent sidetrack higher up in the well. The operations on B-38 started on the 14th of March 2000. The well was kicked off below the pre-installed 185/8 casing in B-38 at 1180 MD / 983 TVD. 171/2 hole was drilled to 3487 MD / 2135 TVD, and the 133/8 casing set at 3486 MD / 2134 TVD. The 121/4 hole was drilled to 5583 MD / 2662 TVD in the Upper Ness channel sand, and the 95/8 casing was run with the shoe at 5582 m MD / 2661 TVD. subhorizontal 81/2 section was drilled to TD for the well at 7082 MD / 2824 TVD in the Dunlin Group, reached on the 27th of April 2000.

Seismic profiles from the 3D amplitude cube and the acoustic impedance cube along the B-38 well track are given in Figures A-2 and A-3, respectively. The discrepancy between prognosed (adjusted to the drilled location) and actual depths of formation tops at reservoir level are more or less within the estimated uncertainty range, indicating that the seismic interpretation is fairly accurate in the area and that most of the discrepancy is caused by the velocity estimation in the depth conversion. The Base Brent in the toe end of the 30/9-B-38 at 7029 MD, was found 20 shallower than prognosed. This indicates that the interpretation needs some adjustment in this area. Above the reservoir, the drilled formation tops for 30/9-B-38 are consistently shallower than prognosed. This indicates that too low velocities have been used in the time-to-depth conversion for these horizons. At reservoir level, the seismic data quality along the first 2/3 of the horizontal section is considered to be fairly good, as indicated in Figure A-2. However, pronounced deterioration is observed towards the toe end, especially for the Base Brent reflector. This is probably related to degradation of reservoir sands in the Oseberg Formation towards south on the Gamma South Structure. Generally, in the Oseberg Field, low acoustic impedance values (green to blue colours on the seismic profile, Figure A-3) are indicative of sand. In the area of well Experience from drilling of 30/9-B-38 indicate high degree of correlation between low acoustic impedance intervals and sandy sequences.

A 1087 long subhorizontal section was drilled in Upper Ness (Figure A-6). Channel sand was penetrated as planned. Due to risk of hole stability problems in the last part of the horizontal section it was decided not to drill to Target #5. The well path was dropped into Lower Ness 3-5 at Target #4, and ~10 thick LN4 channel sand was penetrated. The well path was dropped into ORELN2, no sand was penetreted in this part of the well, and it was concluded that there is no reservoir potential in these reservoir zones in this part of the Gamma South structure, which excluded drilling of the planned B-39 sidetrack. B-38 is perforated in Upper Ness and Lower Ness 3-5, and the total length of perforation is 814 m. The well was completed with remote zone control (Table A-5, Figure A-7). Table A-5.

The methodology employed in the evaluation is also summarized. All depths quoted in this section are in MD RKB unless otherwise stated.

Environmental corrections other than real time borehole corrections applied by the field engineer were not applied to the data. The parameters used to perform the petrophysical evaluations are presented in Table A-8, Table A-9, and Table A-12. The petrophysical evaluation of the well was based on the results and methology developed in Oseberg Petrophysical Field Review 1999-2000 (Norsk Hydro 2000) (Ref /4.1/). Porosity The total porosity was calculated from the Density log. Grain density and fluid density values used in the calculation were zonal dependent. Zonal grain density values and zonal fluid density values are based on core analysis from cored wells. The effective porosity was calculated from the equation: PHIe = PHIt - (Vsh PHIshale) where PHIshale: Shale volume Shale volume was calculated using the GR Larionov method. Min. and Max. values for gamma ray were picked from log response for each subzone. Water saturation Effective water saturation Swe has been estimated using the Poupon-Leveaux equation (Indonesia) after correcting the porosity for shale effect. Total water saturation Swt has been estimated using the Dual Water equation. Formation water resistivity Rw used in the calculations is field value based primarily from well 30/9-2 water samples (Ref. /4.2/). Formation temperature was implemented according to the three areal temperature- depth relationships documented in the Oseberg Production Technology Design Basis, (Ref /4.3/). Coal sections were predicted by discrimation (density<2.10 g/cc, Neutron>0.35 frac). Additional editing was necessary. Calcite sections were predicted manually. In these sections porosity was set to and water saturation to 1. The equations of shale volume, porosity, water saturation and formation temperature are presented in Oseberg Petrophysical Field Review 1999-2000 (Norsk Hydro 2000) (Ref /4.1/). Permeability Permeability Kh was calculated from Artificial Neural Nets (ANN) developed by the Norsk Hydro F-senter Bergen, in cooperation with NTNU Trondheim (Ref. /4.4/).

Installed new tubing head, high pressure riser and BOP. Sat packstock and milled window in 5/8 casing from 4228 to 4232 MD, and drilled 18 new formation to 4250 MD. 1.2 Drilling of B-38 8 1/2 section: Drilled 17 before the MWD tool failed. Changed the AutoTrak and Tripple Combo and drilled to 5831 MD, where the circulation was lost. Were not able to establish circulation with LCM material or cement plug on bottom. Could not determine where the loss zone was, so the well was plugged back to 4519 MD with three cement plugs. 8 1/2 section (T2): The first AutoTrak failed pulsing at the test at 1000 MD. Changed the AutoTrak and hit soft cement at 4519 MD. Washed down to 4536 MD and drilled cement to 4559 MD. Tried to sidetrack, but succeeded first at 4674 MD due to soft cement and limestone stringers. Kicked off and drilled to 5269 MD where the string went stuck. Got free and drilled to 5293 MD before the string went stuck again at 5283 MD when backreaming the stand. After 10 hours of jarring and working the string up and down it came free and was pulled out. Ran in the hole with new AutoTrak when the drillstring packed off at 4562 MD. Had to pull out of the hole because of the significant hole cleaning problem and ran into the hole with cleanout assembly. Reamed down from 4260 MD to 4670 MD where the string packed of and got stuck. The attemt to clean the hole was not successful. Due to the increasing hole stability problem and the amount of hole left to drill, it was decided to abondon B-38 and drill the well from below the 18 5/8 casing shoe.

Lithology: Chalk/limestone, white to very light greyish white, ficiLt to moderately indurated, sub-blocky, micritic, rare chert/flint, trace crystalline pyrite. Micropalaeontology: The samples below 2,880m contain moderately diverse planktic association, dominated by common G. pseudobulloides, Globoconusa daubjergensis, together with rare Eoglobigerina spp., & triloculinoides and occasional Planorotalites compressa. The presence of C. daubjergensis is consistent with the middle - early Danian age indicated by the n.annofloral recovery. Late Cretaceous reworking (F. elegans, calcispheres) is noted below 2,895m, becoming increasingly more common downhole. Calcareous Nann.oplankton: At, and below, 2,880m there is change in the nannofloral assemblages recovered. The samples at 2,880m and 2,889m are characterised by an increase in the abundance of Prinsius tenuiculus, Thoracosphaera operculath and the amount of reworked Late Cretaceous taxa recorded and in the notable absence of Neochlastozygus modes fits and saepes. This is taken to indicate passage of the wellpath into sediments of middle Damian (Zone NNTp3) age. Of note is the occurrence of Mantholithus sparsus at 2,889m, and although this taxon has published range higher than this level, it is really only recorded in triddle/early Danian sediments in the North Sea, thus supporting this age attribution. The recovery and preservation in the samples analysed at 2,895 and 2,898m was much poorer than in previous samples. The assemblages recovered are characterised by an increase in the reworked Late Creataceous components, although rare Danian restricted taxa such as Pnnslus tenuicalus and Cruciplacolithus spp. are recorded. single specimen of Kantholithus hughesii recorded at 2,898m (if in-situ) may indicate the presence of early Damian (Zone NNTpl) age sediments. Stratigraphic Comments: The precise top of the Late Maastrichtian Tor Formation is made difficult to determine because of the increasing amount of reworking towards the base of the Ekofisk Formation. In the absence of wireline log data the major increase in Maastrichtian recovery at 2,901m has been used to define the formation break.', 'Passage_id': 1187}, {'prompt': \"\\nWELLBORE NAME: 8/3-1 \\n\\nPARAGRAPH: Esso PRonucTioN RESEARCH COMPANY BAsix GEOLOGY DIVISION W.

None of the samples had as much as 45 percent wet gas, although at 6,425 feet the gas content was 44 percent wet. l In Canada Imperial fiLids that cuttings gas that is less than 45 percent wet is generaly associated with sections that produce either dry gas or heavy asphaltic oils, except for nonproauctiv sections that also yield low amounts of cuttings gas. However, in the Permian section of west Texas we have found that oil production may be associated with sections for which the cuttings gas is as low as 20 percent wet. Thus, it appears that different basins have different rules of association in interpreting cuttings gas results. , !- 10.1 The interTi that produced the greatest amountep4gas is roughly from 6,500 to 6,95e-feet. The extremely high value t,687 feet came from cuttings that contain coal and shale fragments.

The reason for questioning your results is due to our conversations with the Esso well site geologists. They reported through the same interval, only minimal readings of gas on the mud log-chromatograph, and no indications of gas on their cuttings analysis. Numerous checks of the chromatograph were reportedly made, and on each occasion known gases were correctly identified. The lack of mud log gas indications at the well site, can of course, be explained by the possibility of poor gas trapping mechanics, but their negative cuttings analysis is in direct opposition to your results. It is also interesting that within your reported high gas interval, several porous sands were drilled and/or cored that had no hydrocarbon shows as indicated by mud log, visual examination, and E-log analysis. In order to fully evaluate and use these contradictory data, we feel it imwative that we have complete understanding of the problems and limits error of both recording instruments. zone as gassy as indicated by your analysis would certainly cause re-evaluation of the potential of the stratigraphic section penetrated by this well.
