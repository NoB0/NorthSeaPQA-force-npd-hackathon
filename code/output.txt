Co-ordinates refer to the European Datum 1950 and 1JTM projection, Zone 31 with central meridian de- grees east, and were furnished by the client. The Micro-Fix antenna was mounted at the top of the wheelhouse. A Pulse/8 receiver was also used. The receiver was interfaced to HP 9845 computer for on-line com- putation from two up to six patterns, graphical data display and recording of raw data on magnetic tape. The Pulse/8 antenna was mounted on top of the wheel- house. Static corrections for the four patterns of Northern Chain North Sea Pule/8 were taken from A/S Geoteam Report 30266.8.

During anchor handling at the old location, Micro- fix was used. The rig headed for new location 1710 hours, 17 October. 1800 hours it was changed over to Pulse/8 due to instability of two Micro-Fix ranges. After four anchors were on to Micro-Fix for accurate then received all stations unstable from time to time. bottom, we changed back positioning. Micro-Fix well, only code 11 was Tension test was completed 0655 hours 18 October.3.1 RECORDING AND PROCESSING Logging of Micro-Fix started 1241 hours 18 October. At 1304 hours some paperfeed problems on the computer occurred. They were solved and logging was restarted at 1324 hours. Only data from this time on was used for statistical purposes. The logging was stopped at 2319 hours 18 October. That gives logging period of hours and 55 minutes. total of about 1480 loggings was made with intervals of 24 seconds. Statistical analysis of the one sigma distribution was concurrently displayed on-line. The histo- graphic plots are shown in Appendix 3. The characteristics of the Micro-Fix ranges location were: Station Distance (km) *Line of Sight Ratio Direction Statfjord 2680 Statfjord 2950 Brent 237 *Line of sight ratio = Distance/Line of SightThe Micro-Fix system measures the internal delays in both mobile and beacons continuously, and subtracts those delays from the readings before output. There- fore, it claims to be self-calibrating system without any need of further calibration values. The statistical results from the final recordings are summarized below. Code Number of Mean Standard Number of Accepted Value Deviation Omitted Readings (metres) (one sigma) Readings Readings deviating more than times one sigma have been omitted in the analyses. Meaningless readings are not counted. By applying the average of the readings and least squares adjustment, minimizing the range residuals, and applying the antenna offset given in Appendix 5.1, the Well centre was found to be: Latitude 61 12' Northing 787 in Longitude 02 16' Easting 460 in Position refers to the European Datum 1950, UTM pro- jection, Zone 31 with central meridian degrees East.PAGE REPORT 3.2 ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS Final Micro-Fix position was derived from least squares adjustment, giving standard error of ob- servation of unit weight, one sigma, of metres with residuals as follows: Station Name Code Residual Statfjord 10 in Statfjord 06 in Brent 02 Brent 11 in The general performance, as far as stability and ac- curacy of the system is concerned, was satisfactory throughout the rig move.PAGE 10 4.

POSITION FIXING WITH SATELLITE DATA 5.1 OBSERVATIONS The final position of DEEPSEA BERGEN was derived from recorded data from transit satellite observa- tions, utilizing the translocation method. This method uses simultaneous data from separate stations to determine the relative position of one station with respect to another. The translocation method determines three-dimensional position by compen- sating for the error in an individual satellite position. The principal sources of error in an in- dividual satellite position fix are the orbit definition provided by the satellite and residual tropospheric and ionospheric refraction errors. Pre- cise compensation for these errors is possible when the same signal is received at separate sites. The practical limit on north-south separation of the sites is thought to be around 1000 km. The east- west separation is somewhat more critical in that the number of common passes decreases rapidly as the east-west separation increases, due to the critical angle of elevation of the satellite. Eigeberg which is near Stavanger was used as known reference station. The actual marker at the station was hole on top of concrete column. The rig lies 322 km north-west of Eigeberg. Observations and recording of satellite data com- menced at Eigeberg at 1600 hours 18 October and were completed at 1800 hours, 20 October 1985, period of 50 hours. total of 57 passes were recorded with 53 passes accepted for post 2-D computation, giving an average time between each 2-D pass of 57 minutes.PAGE 13 At DEEPSEA BERGEN observations and recording of satellite data commenced at 1200 hours, 18 October and continued to 1220 hours, 20 October 1985, period of 48 hours, 20 minutes. total of 62 passes were recorded, with 49 passes accepted for post 2-D computation, giving an average time between each 2-D pass of 59 minutes. 5.2 DATUM SHIFT The known station at Eigeberg is 1. order geodetic fix point and the co-ordinates, referenced to the European Datum 1950, were furnished by N.G.O. (The Geographical Survey of Norway). Since the computation of positions are carried out on the satellite's geodetic system (the NWL-10D sys- tem), the co-ordinates for Eigeberg had to be trans- formed from the European Datum 1950 to this system. The transformation parameters shown below are appli- cable in the Norwegian Sea south of 640, provided the station co-ordinates have been established using the satellites Broadcast Ephemeriesn. Dx = 83 Dy = 110 Dz = 118 Translation (X, and constitute right-hand co-ordinate sys- tem fixed in the spheroid. and lie in the equa- torial plane and the Z-axis coincides with the rota- tion axis of the spheroid. is positive towards the Prime Meridian and towards 900E longitude. is positive towards the North.)PAGE 14 Co-ordinates for Eigeberg, referenced to the European Datum 1950, as furnished by N.G.O., are: CONCRETE COLUMN Latitude 580 51' Longitude 05 35' Height of concrete column Antenna height Geoid height above ED 50 el. NNN 1957 Height above ellipsoid ED 50 See Appendix for station description. By applying the datum shift parameters, the co- ordinates for Eigeberg, referenced to the satellites geodetic system, are: Latitude 58 51' Height This gives the following datum shift correction for Eigeberg (from NWL-10D to the European Datum 1950): Latitude + Longitude + Height in 5.3 PROCESSING All the raw satellite data were stored on magnetic tape cassettes. The data were analysed and proces- sed on our VAX 11/780 computer system using the Magnavox MAGNET programme.PAGE 15 The quality of pass is normally characterized by the Root Mean Square (RMS) value for the scatter of all the Doppler counts in that particular pass, ex- pressed in centimetres (cm). For onshore work, limit of 25 cm is normally used, while rig observa- tions are considered good if they have RMS value less than 40 cm. After processing with different acceptance criteria, a limit of 40 cm was selected for this trans- location. Before 3-D processing there were 33 passes common to both Eigeberg and Deepsea Bergen. Four passes were removed by the operator to achieve better geometry, and three passes were rejected during processing, giving total of 26 accepted passes. The following table gives the number of satellite passes in each direction: SITE NW NE SW SE TOTAL DEEPSEA BERGEN 26 Eigeberg 26 E and indicate passes East or West of the ob- server's meridian while and indicate Northgoing or Southgoing passes. When evaluating results from different solutions, special attention is paid to RMS value of the dop- pler counts, elevation at closest approach, geometry and the amount of rejections.41.147TE*\\ \ PAGE 16 By utilizing these passes, the antenna position was determined to be, referenced to the satellite datum: Latitude: 610 12' Longitude: 020 16' Applying the given datum shift parameters, the satellite antenna co-ordinates on DEEPSEA BERGEN, in the European Datum 1950, are: ANTENNA POSITION Latitude 610 13' Northing 787 Longitude 02 16' Easting 460 The UTM co-ordinates refer to Zone 31 with central meridian degrees east. This gave the following datum shift corrections on the rig (from NWL-10D to the European Datum 1950): 5.4 REDUCTION TO WELL CENTRE The offsets between the MX-1502 Geoceiver antenna and the anticipated Well centre were as shown in Appendix 5.3, Antenna Offsets. The rig heading, read from the rig's gyrocompass, was 311 degrees.V PAGE 17 REPORT With these data, the Well centre co-ordinates have been computed as: Latitude 610 12' Northing 787 in Longitude 020 16' Easting 460 The co-ordinates refer to the European Datum 1950 and UTM zone 31 with central meridian degrees east. Well centre is metres off intended location in direction 201 degrees. The antenna height on the rig was computed to be  metres in the European Datum 1950 (above the spheroid). The distance from sea surface to elec- trical centre of the antenna was measured to be metres, thus the computed geoid height is metres. 5.5 ACCURACY CONSIDERATIONS Based on the scatter of the observations, one sigma value of metres has been computed for the latitude, metres for longitude and metres for height, giving horizontal position accuracy of 1.1 metres (one sigma), relative to Eigeberg. The accuracy of the position is affected by both ionispheric and tropospheric refraction. Further, any uncertainty in the known altitude will result in erroneous east-west position. We estimate the hori- zontal accuracy for the antenna position to be better than + metres, relative to Eigeberg.PAGE 18 Reduction from antenna position to Well centre posi- tion may introduce an additional error of + metres due to uncertainty in rig heading and the scaled an- tenna offsets. Three common passes failed (10%) the main acceptance criteria for being included in the final position. With an acceptance criteria of 40 cm rms-, the data can be characterized as being of fair quality.PAGE 19 6.
