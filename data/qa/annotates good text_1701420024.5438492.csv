Job Summary 32 30 conductor casing The 36 hole was drilled to TD at 229 MD. The conductor was cemented from the shoe at 229 MD and back to the mudline at 154m MD. Prior to the job there was discussion on compressive strength development of conductor cement slurries. Several options were discussed, but the job was conducted with single 15.80ppg cement slurry. 200% excess volume was used.

The 20 13 3/8 casing was run to 1076 m MD and cemented by pumping 703bbls 13.2ppg lead slurry, and 159bbls 15.80ppg tail slurry. 100 % excess on open hole was used for volume calculations. The cement slurries were displaced with seawater at an average rate of 12.6bpm with the rig pumps. During the cement job there was trouble with the bulk system leading to stops in the cement delivery to the mixing unit several times during the job. Non-continuos cement delivery makes it difficult for the cementer to keep constant density on the cement slurry. Due to incorrect use of the cement head, the releasing dart did not go. Thus, the SSR top plug was never sheared and the cement was displaced without top wiper plug, leaving no barrier between the cement slurry and the displacement fluid (seawater). The casing was pressure tested to 1500psi (52 hours after the cement job). The pressure test was acceptable.

Before pulling out of the hole, the brine in the well was displaced with 11.0ppg OBM (11.0ppg OBM remained behind the casing).",True,d,25/8-10 S,25/8-10,EXPLORATION,DRILLING,WELLBORE_DOCUMENTS,DRILLING_CEMENT_1997-08-31_REPORT_1.PDF,<25/8-10 S> Cementing Services Operation Well Report: Well Drilling Cement End of Well Report (EOWR).,Vr Energi AS,14.09,Y,2021-12-01 14:23:50,Y,20.0,2017-08-31 00:00:00,PDF,1399125.0,REP,COMPANY LEGACY DATA,ACQ,WL.DRILL,,WELL_25_8-10/WB_S_883-L/WELLBORE_DOCUMENTS_1997-08-31,DRILLING_CEMENT_1997-08-31_REPORT_1.PDF,10179928665.0,14.09.01.00,2023-04-25 00:00:00,2023-09-03 12:39:23,What was the test pressure of the cement plug in well 25/8-10 S?,Test pressure was 1000psi.,The test pressure of the cement plug in the well 25/8-10 S was 1000psi.,1
