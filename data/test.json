METHODS 2.1 Habitat Survey Procedures 2.1.1 Interpretation of Geophysical Data The side scan sonar data was thoroughly examined as each line was acquired in order to determine the presence and type of features present, and to gauge the general extent of any features of interest. Once 100% coverage of the Cooper survey site had been achieved the onboard environmental scientists were familiar with all facies present and confident as to which type should be investigated further, with particular focus on those thought to represent potential coral mounds. The side scan sonar data was then reviewed with preliminary bathymetric data to compare sonar features with topographic variations (see Error! Reference source not found.). Figure 2.1: Example Side Scan Sonar Signatures of Lophelia (See Figure for locations) A D E Distinct sonar data signatures were considered to correspond with the presence of the cold-water coral, Lophelia pertusa; which, according to the bathymetric data, occurred on the berms (sides) of iceberg ploughmarks (Figure 2.1); the distribution of these facies rarely appeared to be independent of iceberg ploughmarks. Iceberg ploughmarks were found to be prevalent throughout the site, and cold- water coral communities are known to favour the flanks of the ploughmarks due to the greater exposure to food-bearing water currents. Areas of coarse material were generally associated with the edges of the many iceberg plough marks, indicative of hard substratum suitable for colonisation by Lophelia pertusa. The mottled patches with shadowing in the sonar data were thought to indicate coral pinnacles, while the ellipsoidal forms of generally lower reflectivity were thought to correspond to older, degraded fringes of the coral mounds (Figure 2.1). All such facies within the Cooper site were delineated and mapped from the 100% side scan sonar mosaic, and later reviewed against mosaics composed of only even lines and only odd lines. The delineated areas were then reviewed and FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 11",

Seabed photography was acquired using an SES deepwater high resolution digital stills camera system, and video camera. The camera systems were attached to subsea camera frame, complete with underwater strobe, four LED lamps and USBL beacon. The lamps, manual still photography, and video recording were controlled by use of topside control unit. Seabed video footage was displayed on monitor and recorded directly onto hard disk drive. video overlay superimposed navigation string from the ships reference point, showing the easting and northing coordinates of the camera. The survey location, station number and date were also displayed. See example video clips via hyperlinks in Table 2.2. 2.2 Seabed Photography Interpretation Methodology To characterise the seabed sediments and fauna within the survey site, detailed analysis of video and stills photography data was undertaken by experienced marine biologists / taxonomists. Each still photograph was classified according to the sediment type and any identifiable epifauna (surface-living animals) were recorded in detailed digital stills photograph log (Appendix B.2). Similarly, video data was reviewed, noting the locations of any observed changes in sediment type and / or associated faunal community (Appendix B.3). Particular attention was paid to any vulnerable environmental resources, as defined by Chapter of the Activities Regulations (Petroleum Safety Authority Website), and Norwegian Red List species. Details of relevant Norwegian Red List species are provided in Section 1.4. An in house classification system, modified from that proposed by Moen and Svenson (2004) has been used to more accurately describe the coral formations typically encountered in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. As such, reef structure is classified into five zones; Lophelia pertusa (gravel), Lophelia pertusa (dead), Lophelia pertusa (poor), Lophelia pertusa (moderate) and Lophelia pertusa (good). Areas of non-coral habitat are classified as either soft sediments or mixed sediments, while occurrences of corals other than Lophelia pertusa are classified as other corals. For the purpose of this survey colonies of other corals were numerically recorded along each camera transect (Appendix B.3; Figure to Figure 3.11). Table describes the eight classifications in greater detail and includes hyperlinks to example video clips. An example photograph of each classification is provided in Figure and Section 3.3.

Coral classification was carried out along the camera transects with the colour infills matching description of the coral, found in the chart legend. 3.3 Habitat Descriptions The seabed habitats have been classified using the available geophysical data in combination with the ground-truthing evidence. All seabed video footage and digital stills photographs were reviewed in detail. Detailed logs of the data obtained are provided in Appendix C. Occurrences of the Norwegian Red List species Lophelia pertusa were classified into five categories (gravel, dead, poor, moderate and good) in accordance with Table 2.2. Occurrences of the soft coral species Paragorgia arborea and Primnoa resedaeformis were assigned to the other corals category, whilst the sediment type encountered across the survey site was separated into two types (soft sediments and mixed sediments). Sections 3.3.1 to 3.3.8 provide brief description of each habitat, the associated fauna and the general distributions across the survey site. Further information on the distribution of habitats is provided in Section and details of habitat distribution in relation to the proposed development are provided in Section 3.4.2. Information on the sediment type and fauna evident on each still photograph and on the seabed video footage was used to classify the habitat. For the purposes of this report the European Nature Information Service (EUNIS) coding system was used for the classification of biotopes. This is marine biotope classification system for European waters that has been developed by the European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity and the European Environmental Information Observation Network and is based on hierarchical analysis of habitat. Initially marine habitats are defined at eight broad levels, biological communities are then linked to these (at three lower levels) to produce biotope classification. Table 3.1: The EUNIS Biotope Classification Hierarchy Level Hierarchy Description Example Classification Name Example Classification Code 1 Environment Marine habitats 2 Broad Habitat Type Deep-sea bed A6 3 Habitat complex Deep-sea bioherms A6.6 4 Biotope complex Communities of deep-sea corals A6.61 5 Biotope Deep-sea (Lophelia pertusa) reefs A6.611 3.3.1 Soft Sediments The soft sediment habitat comprised fine silty, slightly gravelly sand with sandy clay in areas, as described in the seabed features (Section 3.2). Soft sediment was typically observed in areas between iceberg ploughmarks and in the central sections within the ploughmarks. The deeper, offshore sediment biotopes are not described to the same level of detail as their shallower, more accessible counterparts and are currently in development by EUNIS, as more data is acquired. This habitat and its associated faunal assemblage may be described by the EUNIS biotopes A5.27 Deep circalittoral sand and A6.4 Deep-sea muddy sand, which comprise offshore (deep) circalittoral habitats with fine sands or non-cohesive muddy sands and include diverse range of polychaetes, amphipods, bivalves and echinoderms (EUNIS, 2011).

The recorded epifauna comprised sea cucumbers (Parastichopus tremulus); various seastars (Asteroidea), particularly yellow seastars (Henricia sp.); the pencil sea urchin (Cidaris cidaris), sea urchins (Echinoidea); brittlestars (Ophiuroidea); various sponges (on occasional gravel and cobbles) including Phakellia sp. and the blue sponge Hymedesmia paupertas to lesser extent, also the stalked sponge (Stylocordyla borealis) was found on one occasion during Transect 4; green spoon worm (Bonellia viridis); squat lobsters (Galatheoidea); crabs (Decapoda); various fish, particularly the redfish (Sebastes sp.) and cod-like fish (Gadidae). Considerable numbers of Gadidae fish were often observed, many of which appeared to be feeding. Bioturbation, in the form of burrows, was recorded throughout the majority of soft sediment areas, indicating the presence of relatively large infauna, most likely shrimp (Caridea). An example photograph of the soft sediment habitat is provided in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Example Photograph of Soft Sediment (Trans_01) Krill 3.3.2 Mixed Sediments Laser points 15 cm apart Redfish, Sebastes sp. The mixed sediment habitat displayed similar characteristics to the soft sediment habitat, but encompassed coarser sediment fraction, consisting of patches of pebbles, cobbles and occasional glacial erratic boulders. The density of the coarse fraction was observed to vary across the habitat, showing wide spatial distribution and generally associated with the flanks of the iceberg ploughmarks. The distribution of coarse sediments in this region is commonly determined by glacial processes; ridges of lithic material were formed by the ploughing motion of icebergs through the seabed which were then infilled by fine sediment, whilst the scattered boulders are typically the result of glacial deposition. Identification of mixed sediment areas from side scan sonar data was reliable as FSLTD/Report No 00604V2.3 Page 20",

The following were, however, noted: - The DEN/NEU separation in the oil zone is higher than theoretically expected. This is seen in both the 12 1/4 and in the %2 section. - The resistivity curves are noisy for high values of resistivity indicating that the tool is close to the upper limit of the tool. - In the same formation and fluid (Garn oil zone) the resistivity from the 12  section  P28H_UNC from ARC is reading significantly lower than P34H_UNC from ARC in the %2 section. Raw curves are listed in Table 4-1. 3.2 Composite curves The composites curves (and evaluation curves) are listed in Table 4-2 were details about splice depths, depth shifting and editing are found. The composite curves were created from LWD curves in both the %2 and in the 12 1/4 section. 3.3 Processing The processing was done according to the Heidrun Evaluation model as of 2003. Well specific parameters are listed in Table 3-1 The quality of the evaluation curves (QUAL_FLAG) were defined as medium in this well mainly based on the uncertainties associated with the raw curves as mentioned in section 3.1. In the gas zone there is additional uncertainties in the evaluation due to uncertainty associated with mud invasion effects. Due to the differences in resistivity responses in the 12 1/4 and in the %2 section the calculated water saturation Sw becomes quite different in the two sections. From field knowledge it is to be expected that Sw in the %2 section is closest to the true value.",

The resistivity log is corrected for borehole conditions and both Apparent Resistivity (RSAX) and Corrected Resistivity (RSCX) are presented on the log. The Gamma Detector is Scintillation device, calibrated to API units. The Computerized Directional Sensor (CDS) provides directional surveys (Toolface, Azimuth and Inclination) and downhole circulating temperature. DUAL PROPAGATION RESISTIVITY (DPR) TOOL The Dual Propagation Resistivity (DPR) tool comprises of resistivity sensor which measures resistivity by emitting MHz electromagnetic wave into the formation. This wave is monitored by the two receiving antennaes, spaced apart, hence giving outstanding bed definition. The sensor measures the Phase Difference (PD) and Amplitude Ratio (AR) for the wave, which are transformed mathematically into resistivity values. The two resistivity measurements have different depths of investigation. The Amplitude Ratio Resistivity (PAR) reads deepest into the formation, while Phase Difference Resistivity (RPD) is the most accurate at high resistivities and offers the best vertical resolution. The tool also includes Computerized Directional Sensor (CDS) giving directional surveys (Toolface, Azimuth and Inclination) and downhole circulating temperature. The Scintillation Gamma ray detector is calibrated to the MWD-API standard. In addition, the tool features downhole memory, which samples data every six seconds. The sampling time is programmable and can be changed on the rig. Realtime data is transmitted to the surface. When the DPR tool is raised above the RKB, the memory is dumped and the data processed in order to produce high quality log with excellent definition and detail. Hence the DPR tool provides both real-time data (Measurement-While Drilling, MWD data) and memory data (Recorded While Drilling, RWD data). MODULAR TRIPLE COMBO TOOL The Teleco Modular Triple Combo tool comprises of the same sensors as the DPR tool, (directional, temperature, gamma ray and DPR resistivity) in addition to the Modular Neutron Porosity tool and Modular Density Lithology tool. -1-",

The pressure pulse is generated by piston moving towards valve seat, temporarily restricting the flow and causing pressure increase. There are at the moment two ways of transmitting the binary (ones and zeros) stream of digits to the surface. BIPHASE CODE The transmitted data consists of stream of binary digits (ones and zeros). Each bit takes certain length of time, one data cell width, to transmit. Independent of the data rate, bit is represented by a level change (valve motion) at the start of the bit. bit has level change at the start and middle of the bit. Consequently each bit requires either one or two movements by the piston. The Biphase code performs well under difficult decoding conditions. MILLER CODE Miller code is an alternative to Biphase code. It requires less valve motions to transmit the same number of bits. This means that the transmission frequency can be lowered, while the data rate is maintained. With Miller x4M we get the same valve movement as with the X2 Biphase, but twice as much data is transmitted to the surface. is presented by level change in the middle of the bit. has no level change, unless it is followed by another 0, in which case there is level change at the end of the first bit period. SPLITPHASE CODE New generation Teleco MWD tools will have the ability to be programmed for splitphase code. This is new method of data transmission that allows the same high data rate as the Miller code, while being more robust and allowing more signal noise. With splitphase is represented by negative going level change in the middle of the bit, while is represented by positive going level change (pressure rise) in the middle of the bit. 4.11.4 TIME PER DATA BIT FOR THE DIFFERENT CODES X2 BIPHASE X3 BIPHASE X4 MILLER X6 MILLER X4 SPLITPHASE X6 SPLITPHASE (X2B) (X3B) (X4M) (X6M) (X4 S) (X6S) 2.50 sec/bit 1.67 sec/bit 1.25 sec/bit 0.83 sec/bit -2-",

The well position is on the Utsira High, west of the main fault in the southern part of the block. The well was drilled vertically, with surveys provided by Teleco MWD tools. For the 36 and 17 1/2 pilot hole sections an 1/4 DPR tool was used. For the 17 1/2 hole, 1/4 RGD tools were used. In the 12 1/4 hole DPR service was requested, but Teleco took the opportunity to demonstrate the 1/4 Modular Triple Combo tool that included Neutron Porosity and Density in addition to DPR. Please see the Tool Definition report for further details on the tool types. 9 7/8 PILOT FOR 36 HOLE 145m - 370m RUN # 1. 145m - 196m ROTARY HOLD ASSY The well was spudded with 7/8 BHA comprising of Hughes ATJIS bit with 3x20 nozzles, bit sub, nm p/p sub, MWD, saver sub, monel, DC 11, jar, DC 3, x/o and HWDP 1. The Teleco DPR tool No.8404-10 (450-900 GPM) was picked up and verified at surface before the assembly was run in hole without marine riser and BOP. Started spudding with very little flow, around GPM. This was too little to get good log while drilling. When taking surveys, the same problem occurred. The tool sent just numbers for gamma and resistivity readings. This is clear indication of insufficient flow rate, as the tool does not power up the logging sensors. Due to problems with washing out the hole with an increased flowrate, it was decided by Saga representative to pull out to change the Teleco tool. Two directional surveys were taken during this run, showing an inclination of degrees at the end. The tool accumulated 2.1 circulating hours. RUN # 196m - 370m ROTARY HOLD ASSY After changing the Teleco tool to DPR No.2266-22, the assembly was run in hole and the spudding continued from 196m.

Even with these flowrates the first three of total of surveys, failed to give correct FID, and had to be taken over again. These problems were not encountered below 236m. The realtime log suffered from the lack of appropriate flow and several passages with too high ROP. An excellent memory log, which showed possible shallow gas area around 274m, was produced and presented to the customer. total of directional surveys were taken throughout the run with final inclination of degrees and direction of 136.2 degrees.

The MWD was utilized mainly to check the well path and to avoid possible kick-off. The realtime log produced was of good quality, but showed more trends than actual value due to the large hole diameter. The readings actually reflected seawater more than true formation.

The hole was opened to 26 without any incidents, and the riser and seabed diverter were pulled in preparation to run the 20 casing. During this operation gas bubbles were seen at the seabed by the ROV camera, and corrective action had to be taken. Ran the drill string back to bottom and established circulation, and the mudweight was increased in steps up to SG. The 20 casing was set at 1030m, and the BOP and riser were installed prior to starting to drill. 1045m - 1388m PENDULUM ASSEMBLY Made up rotary drop assembly, comprising of 17 1/2 Smith SS44J4 rockbit with lx16 and 3x18 nozzles, the Teleco RGD tool (SN 8414-5), and 17 1/2 stabilizer placed 23.11m above the bit. The Teleco tool was tested to specification at the first HWDP. Ran in to the top of the cement at 1015m, and drilled cement and float to 1030m. The hole was displaced to SG KCL mud prior to drilling the shoe and cleaning out the rat hole. Drilled another 5m of fresh formation to 1051m and circulated and conditioned the mud prior to performing the LOT, which gave EQMW. This was sufficient to continue drilling. The mudweight was increased while drilling, in preparation of the forthcoming pore-pressure rise. Drilling resumed using the following drilling parameters: 137 RPM, 865 GPM, 10-15 tonnes WOB, at 2300 psi, and gave an ROP between 15 - 25 in/hr. The decoding under these conditions were 100% efficient, and good formation log was recorded. To maintain the rate of penetration the WOB had to be increased to 20 tonnes at 1169m, and accordingly the flow adjusted up to 1000 GPM to optimize hole cleaning. The following surveys showed an inclination build rate, and gave deg at 1271m. Several adjustments were carried out, the WOB was decreased to 5-10 tonnes and the RPM increased to 170. The alterations had limited effects, the angle still showed gradual build and gave maximum reading of deg at 1328m. With the increasing angle the well path direction started to align to around 220-230 deg. The high possibility of missing the first target at 2096m with the present inclination build up rate, led to the decision to POOH at 1388m. The hole packed off at 1363m, resulting in total loss of circulation. Circulation was re-established and the string was backreamed to the 20 casing shoe. Circulated and rotated inside the casing in an attempt to free the string for attached gumbos. Ran back in hole and circulated bottoms up prior to POOH. The tool performed to specification and accumulated total of circulating hours. -3-",

The Saga drilling supervisor requested that the MWD tool was not tested on surface. Ran in to bottom and started drilling with 20 tonnes WOB, RPM of 160 and flow of 910 GPM, giving standpipe pressure of 3300 psi and ROP between 15 - 20 in/hr. survey at 1399m gave an inclination of deg. This angle built to deg at 1428m and further to deg at 1457m. Lower WOB was tried in order to drop angle but to no avail. Throughout the run the angle kept building until the final survey at 1599m which showed an angle of deg. The direction varied between 227.4 deg and deg, corrected to grid north. At 1609m it was decided to pull out of hole to make up motor assembly in order to drop angle.  RUN #  1609m - 1911m MOTOR ASSEMBLY A correction run had to be performed, so motor assembly was built. The BHA comprised of Hughes MAX G3 rock bit dressed with 4x20 nozzles, Navi Drill MKII mud-motor, 17 1/4 sleeve stab, the Teleco RGD tool (S/N 8414-5), another 16 1/2 sleeve stab, the Jar and total of std of DC's and HWDP's. The Teleco tool was not tested on surface on Sagas request. Ran in hole to 1570m, and washed down to bottom. Drilled ahead in alternating steering and rotating mode, using drilling parameters as: 1000 GPM, 10-20 tonnes WOB, 60 surface RPM, giving stand-pipe pressure of 3700 psi. To avoid key-seatings the plan was to turn the well path and control the drop rate, by keeping the toolface around 120 deg R. Some problems were experienced during steering, it was difficult to maintain the optimum toolface region, due to frequent limestone stringers. The actual toolface range during drilling were around deg R, and the well path direction gradually turned to the right while the inclination dropped off as desired. The survey taken at 1698m survey depth gave an inclination of deg and an azimuth of 251.3. Drilling resumed and the angle continued to drop and gave deg at 1780m survey depth. The recorded azimuths varied bit more, due to the relatively low angle. A wiper trip to the shoe was performed at 1800m, and no tight spots were experienced when POOH. Ran back in hole, and reamed down the last stand. Drilling resumed with the objective to change the well path coordinates to the original target centre. At 1911m the assembly was pulled out of hole due to stalling of the mudmotor. -4-",

No wireline logs were run, so the MWD log was accepted as the final log for the section. The tool performed to specification throughout the section. It must be noted that the flowrates used during drilling 970-990 GPM, were higher than the specified setup of the tool turbine, and were not recommended by Teleco engineers on site. These precautions are set in order to prevent excessive turbine wear, and thus prolong the lifetime of the tool. The 17 1/2 pilot hole section commenced at 216m, and was drilled with a SG Gel-Mud. As mentioned above the prime objective of the logging service was to distinguish whether gas sands were present, and a few interesting features must be noted. When drilling the 7/8 pilot hole possible gas sand was logged at 274m, with resistivity response of ohm-m. The 17 1/2 pilot hole section was drilled several days later and thus the already drilled formation down to 370m had been opposed to mud invasion. When relogging the section the resistivity spike at 273m was confirmed, but did not clearly identify the presence of gas. The sand stringer in question indicated now that the formation fluid was water. The sand had probably been invaded by the conductive mud, and gave more typical thin bed response where low resistivity spike is followed by high resistivity spike. The following high resistivity might also have been a shoulder bed effect. Other thin bed responses can be seen at 340m and 525m The sand stringer at 478-479m gave doubtful resistivity response, the peak might indicate gas, but it could also be that the sand is harder at the bottom. The ROP was at all times controlled and does not quite reflect the formation changes. The Saga Geologists at the site did not fully exclude the possibilities of the presence of shallow gas, but no positive gas horizons were seen on the MWD log. No significant gas peaks were recorded by Geoservices, but this might be due to approximately SG overbalance in mudweight, when comparing to the calculated pore-pressure. The separation of the two resistivity curves in the clay sequences are due the dielectric constants of the formations. The tool's memory was downloaded and an excellent RWD log was produced and given to Saga. -2-",

The RGD-RAW tool (S/N 8414-5) performed to specification throughout the section. high data density MWD log was recorded, and given to the Saga representatives. The log gave clear picture of the formation changes, and correlated excellent to wireline logs taken in the offset well. Drilled out the 20 casing shoe with pendulum assembly, with the Teleco MWD tool placed 1.69m behind the bit. Prior to penetrating the shoe the hole had been displaced to SG KCL mud, and accordingly the gamma ray trace on the log had to be corrected for the potassium content in the mud. LOT was taken and the pressure obtained in the formation below the shoe was sufficient to commence drilling. The log confirmed the casing shoe depth at 1030m, and the 26 rathole down to 1045m which are reflected by the lower gamma and resistivity values. Drilled through the Hordaland formation with controlled rate of penetration of 20-30 m/hr through the predominant claystone lithology, and with drillbreaks up to 50 m/hr in the occasional sand and sandstone layers. Traces of Limestone were seen in the cuttings, but the thin stringers were not picked up by the MWD 16 Short Normal resistivity device. The Balder formation was encountered at 1925m, and can be seen on the log by gradual declining gamma and an increasing resistivity trend. From 1963m the gamma values rose steadily and marked the transition into the Sele formation at 1975m, where the gamma ray levelled at 50-60 MWD-API. The resistivity trace on the log didn't clearly identify this transition, but stabilized at lower level around ohm-m (R corr). Drilled down to prognosed 2050m with no major problems. Tight holes were encountered in sections due to the hydrating properties of the Claystone. Borehole diameter and mud resistivity corrections have been applied to the resistivity (R corr) trace on the log. Under the present logging conditions the factors applied are just under the acceptable limits for the type of tool in use, causing the large separation between corr and app due to the high salinity of the mud. -3-",

This tool measures and transmit Neutron Porosity and Formation Density in addition to the normal services the DPR tool gives. The hole was logged with wireline after the drilling was completed. Included in the well report are DPR logs only. At the time of performing this field test algorithms for an 8 1/4 Neutron Porosity and Density tool were not available. Porosity logs are calculated in Connecticut and will be given to Saga later. After hours the tool was partially plugged, and stopped transmitting realtime data. Drilling continued, and after about 70m the tool started transmitting again. The pulses were very small but very good realtime log was obtained. The missing sequence was relogged during wiper trip, and realtime log was produced for the hole section. The memory log was recorded during the missing transmission as the turbine was working. Therefore memory log was obtained for the hole section, and presented to the customer. This section was drilled with SG. KCL-mud. The KCL content was kept at around 40 ppb. During drilling the ROP varied between - 30 m/hr which gave an excellent realtime and memory log. While Drilling no significant problems could be notified, which could have effected the logging of the formation by the Teleco MWD tool. -4-",

The assembly experienced difficulty steering in the under pressured Heimdal formation and the penetration rate was low and after 37 hours on bottom it dropped to zero. Another rock bit of the same type as the previous one was run in order to drop the angle before the penetration of the Shetland limestone. In order to avoid fault the well was also steered to the west. The drilling rate was low in the hard formation and the low gas levels experienced reflect both this and the relatively high overbalance with which it was drilled. The final run of the section utilised PDC bit on rotary steerable assembly with an Anadrill PowerDrive tool. The tool was used to ensure that the near vertical well stayed on target, rather than for drilling deviated well. The section TD was called on cuttings returns, in claystone, below the massive Shetland limestone sequence. Rates of penetration were higher than with the preceding rock bits, but gas values remained low. The 10 3/4 / 5/8 casing was run without incident and minimal losses were observed during the cementing. A rotary assembly with PDC bit was used to drill out the 5/8 shoe and formation integrity test was carried out to 1.90sg after drilling 4m of new formation. The assembly did tend to build angle as the well was extended through the reservoir, but remained within target tolerances. ROPs were low in the hard formation and this eventually forced bit trip within 200m of the expected well TD. The same assembly with an extra stand of drill collars was used in the final run with different PDC bit to extend the well 165m to TD of 4004m MD (3909.2m TVD), which is approximately 174m below the base of the producing zone. The gas levels remained low in this run but the ROP improved in the Dunlin formation. Wireline logs were run at TD before running the 1/2 liner. The well was suspended and trawl protector installed on the well head pending production completion.",

In addition, one litre bottle of mud were taken at the start of mudlogging in each section and at casing points or whenever major changes to the mud system. Further, one geochemical gas-bag sample were taken every 40 metre from 3520m MD to 4000m MD. Lithological analysis of the cuttings was conducted at the wellsite using binocular microscope and an ultraviolet light source. The interpreted lithology is based on cuttings-lithology and drilling parameters such as ROP, WOB, torque, gas levels and MWD-logs. Gas levels were recorded in percent using Total Hydrocarbon Analyser and were broken down into constituent components C1, C2, C3, iC4 and nC4 by Gas Chromatograph measuring in ppm. table of drilled gas peaks is given at the end of each section, giving background gas (BG) and gas peaks with component breakdown.

Cement was tagged at 196 and the section was drilled with seawater and viscous sweeps, with returns going to the seabed. At depth of 269 the top drive failed and bit had to be pulled. Bit No. 2RR Smith 26 M02SO DCPS, jets 1x18, 3x24, Interval drilled: 269  527 m, Drilled 28 in 4,3 hours on bit, Graded: 1-1-ER-A-E-I-NO-DMF Bit No. was re-run with the same assembly as above. At 499 wiper trip to the 30 shoe was performed to clean the hole prior to entering the Utsira sand. At 527 the hole appeared to have packed off and circulation was restricted. After jarring the string free, circulation remained restricted. The bit was pulled to determine the nature and location of the restriction within the drillstring. The spring in the float was found to have broken. Mud motor was filled up with sand, probably when turning the string without pumping while the bit still was stuck. The motor would then work as suction pump. Bit No. 2RR2 Smith 26 M02SO DCPS, jets 1x18, 3x24, Interval drilled: m, Drilled 116 in 2,6 hours on bit, Graded: 1-1-ER-A-E-I-NO-RIG Mud motor and float sub were replaced and assembly, including bit, was run in hole again. Reamed down the two last stands before drilling ahead from 527 m. Drilled to 556 m, repaired top drive and drilled down to 643 m. Decided to displace hole to sg mud and pull out of hole to do maintenance on top drive, Change main bearings. Bit No. 2RR3 Smith 26 M02SO DCPS, jets 1x18, 3x24, Interval drilled: m, Drilled 571 in 9,6 hours on bit, Graded: 1-2-ER-G-E-I-BT-TD Top drive was repaired and previous bottom hole assembly was rerun. The remaining of the 26 section, consisting mainly of Utsira sand, was drilled with penetration rate of 59,4 m/hr, bit weight 10,4 tons, flow 4449 lpm and standpipe pressure 220 bar. At TD of 1214 the hole was displaced to sg mud. Tight spots were experienced in the interval from 1170 to 1015 when pulling out. Maximum over pull was 25 tons. No problems seen above 1015 m.",

The bit was mainly rotated with only short intervals of steering to maintain angle and direction. The average penetration rate for the hole run was m/hr. The pore pressure is decreasing over the interval and the Hermod sand, which has occasionally thin Claystone and Siltstone stringers, is depleted to an estimated pressure of sg. The bit was too aggressive and the torque increased as the bit drilled through the changing lithology. It also was hanging up occasionally. The toolface became difficult to control and the penetration rate dropped at the end of the run. When pulling out of the hole, 30 mtons overpull was seen pulling the first two stands. The background gas level was generally low. Bit No. Smith 15GMDPD, 12 1/4 bit, jets 22, Interval drilled 2640  2771 m, Drilled 311 m, Hours on bottom 38.2, Graded: not available This insert bit was run on the same directional assembly. Dropping the hole angle was priority in the section above the Shetland group. The assembly experienced difficulty steering and ROPs were low in both rotary and oriented drilling. The high overbalance whilst drilling the under pressured Heimdal formation was contributory to the poor performance. Gas levels remained low throughout the run and no connection gases were recorded. When pulling off bottom the jars were frequently operated, possibly as result of differential sticking, although ledges from the numerous limestone stringers is also conceivable. The bit was pulled after the ROP fell to zero and this was interpreted as being due to the bit having dulled. Bit No. Smith 15GMDPD, 12 1/4 bit, jets 1x22, 3x24, Interval drilled 2771  2933 m, Drilled 162 m, Hours on bottom 29.9, Graded: not available This insert rock bit of the same type as the previous one was run on the same directional assembly in order to ensure the correct hole angle for the penetration of the Shetland limestone. In order to avoid fault the well was also steered to the west. The drilling rate was low in the hard formation and the low gas levels experienced reflect both this and the relatively high overbalance with which it was drilled. No connection gases were observed.

This PDC bit was run on rotary steerable assembly with an Anadrill PowerDrive tool. The PowerDrive was used to ensure the vertical well remained on target, rather than for drilling deviated well. The bit achieved higher ROPs than the preceding rock bits. Gas levels were generally low throughout the section, with the exception of what was interpreted to be fractured and gas-charged limestone stringer. Tight hole or sticky conditions were experienced at connections close to TD 1) 1217 none Drilled cmt and LOT 2) 1337 120 none Lose bit and motor 3) 1337 na none Fishing trip",

Interval drilled formation: 3507  3839 m, drilled 332m, Hours on bottom formation: 43, Graded: 2-5-WT-A-X-I-BF-PR. This PDC bit was run on rotary assembly to extend the well through the reservoir section. The cement and shoe track was drilled in hours. The assembly did tend to build angle slightly, but remained within target tolerances. The reservoir was penetrated approximately 50m higher than prognosed. The gas values increased significantly in the reservoir section, with number of peaks. Some of these may be associated with thin coals noted in the cuttings. ROPs were generally low in the hard formation, dropping below m/hr at the end of the run and the decision was taken to pull the bit on this basis.

This PDC bit was run on slightly modified rotary assembly from the previous run. stand of 1/2 drill collars having been added. The ROP was initially low but improved in the Dunlin formation. Gas levels remained low throughout. The MWD tool was run without radioactive sources on this run following technical difficulties at surface. TD for the well was called approximately 174m below the base of the production zone. The well was circulated clean and the bit pulled. Tight hole was experienced between 2700 and 2800m whilst pulling out of hole. The bit was run back to bottom and the hole circulated clean.

This is probably result from the drilling of the casing cement. The sample is however fairly rich in Deflandrea oebisfeldensis, dinocyst species that has its main distribution in the Balder Formation. It may also be common in the upper Sele Formation and it may further be present in the basal part of the Hordaland Gp. The low pollen content in this sample is however not in accordance with the Balder and the Sele Formations, and hence the basal part of the Horda Fm (early Early Eocene) is considered most likely Recovery and preservation: Poor organic recovery and mixed assemblages due to content of casing cement.

Palynology comments: The sample yielded superabundant Deflandrea oebisfeldensis, dinocyst species that has its main distribution in the Balder Formation. It may also be common in the upper Sele Formation and it may further present in the basal part of the Hordaland Gp. The high pollen content, especially of Caryapollenites spp. in this sample is strongly associated with the Balder and the Sele Formations. Cerodinium wardenense has its main distribution in the lower part of the Balder Fm., and it may penetrate the upper SeleFm. The acme in Pterospermella spp., large forms is closely associated with the upper Sele Fm, biozone TP5b1. However, other markers for the deeper part of the Sele Fm, like Cerodinium dartmoorium and Apectodinium spp. are not observed in this well.

The income of common calcareous benthonic foraminifera at 805m may suggest some decrease in water depth from above. Stratigraphic comment: The interval is attributed to the lower Lista Fm. This will say that the majority of the Sele Fm. and the upper Lista Fm/Heimdal equivalent should be present between 775m and the next sample above at 745m. We suspect an unconformity in the spacing between these two samples. The lithostratigraphic correspondence of the TP3a zone (830-860m) is problematic. In the type well for the Vle Fm., Norwegian well 1/3-1, the TP3a zone is clearly present from the top of the Vle Fm. In the Danish sector the zone is located in the lower Lista Fm., the Vile Mbr., and since the latter seems to be generally accepted in regionally simplified lithostratigraphic and biostratigraphic correlation, we tentatively leave the zone within the Lista Fm.",

Job Summary 32 30 conductor casing The 36 hole was drilled to TD at 229 MD. The conductor was cemented from the shoe at 229 MD and back to the mudline at 154m MD. Prior to the job there was discussion on compressive strength development of conductor cement slurries. Several options were discussed, but the job was conducted with single 15.80ppg cement slurry. 200% excess volume was used. The cement slurry was displaced with 55bbls seawater at an average displacement rate of 5.7bpm. No problems were reported during the job. 20 13 3/8 casing A 17 1/2 hole was drilled to 1091 MD. The 20 13 3/8 casing was run to 1076 m MD and cemented by pumping 703bbls 13.2ppg lead slurry, and 159bbls 15.80ppg tail slurry. 100 % excess on open hole was used for volume calculations. The cement slurries were displaced with seawater at an average rate of 12.6bpm with the rig pumps. During the cement job there was trouble with the bulk system leading to stops in the cement delivery to the mixing unit several times during the job. Non-continuos cement delivery makes it difficult for the cementer to keep constant density on the cement slurry. Due to incorrect use of the cement head, the releasing dart did not go. Thus, the SSR top plug was never sheared and the cement was displaced without top wiper plug, leaving no barrier between the cement slurry and the displacement fluid (seawater). The casing was pressure tested to 1500psi (52 hours after the cement job). The pressure test was acceptable. In the following drill out phase, the cement was tagged at 1057 MD (11 below the float collar). The shoe / float collar was drilled out with rock bit with tons W.O.B. and 95 rpm (Drill out time = 1/2 hours). A LOT was performed to ppg after drilling out the shoe track.",

The perforations (1 m) were closed by squeezing 15.80ppg cement slurry with moderate fluid loss properties through the retainer. 12 bbl of cement were squeezed into the formations and 14 bbl were left inside the casing below the retainer. Stung out of the retainer and set 100 balanced plug (12 bbl on top of the retainer, giving TOC at 1525 m. bbl of fresh water spacer was pumped ahead of and behind the cement slurry. An acceptable pressure test and load test was performed after cement had set (WOC time: hrs). Test pressure was 1000psi, the plug was then tagged at 1540 MD and load tested with 10 tons. Plug #2 (1 m): A 200 balanced plug was set inside the casing with TOC just below the 5/8 casing cutting point. The job was performed pumping 24.5bbls 16.0ppg cement slurry. Fresh water was used as spacer (5bbls ahead and bbl behind). Before pulling out of the hole, the brine in the well was displaced with 11.0ppg OBM (11.0ppg OBM remained behind the casing).",

The drilling fluid for the sections with returns to the surface was selected based on: 1. Salinity selection based on hydrate suppression calculation. 2. Inhibition based on laboratory tests performed on cuttings from the offset well drilled by Norsk Hydro in 1997. 3. Selection of lubricant/ROP enhancer based on results from the DEA 90 project tests on ROP improvement. 4. The mud had few components which were included for specific purpose. 5. The mud formulation had to have low formation damage potential. 6. The mud components would not interfere with show interpretation. The SFT, the state pollution authority, was given request to use the DRIL-N-SLIDE in the mud on this well and to discharge the mud to the sea as required. The discharge permit was granted with the following restrictions: 1. The level of the DRIL-N-SLIDE to be kept as low as possible to achieve our ROP goals in the 12 1/4 hole interval up to maximum content of 4%. 2. There would be no discharge of whole mud from the mud pits. 3. The SFT would be provided with report on the performance and how the restrictions were met. The KCl/NaCI PAC drilling fluid with to 4% DRIL-N-SLIDE content was selected for the intermediate and reservoir sections. The testing fluid requirements were more straight forward: 1. solids free, filtered brine (probably sodium chloride brine) was required. 2. The density requirements would be known after the obtaining pressure data from the logging. 3. kill pill would be required to kill the well at the end of the testing program. 4. All the fluids had to go through the sand control screens which had 200 micron openings. The sodium chloride brine was selected for the testing fluid and BARAPLUG (sized salt) kill pill which has been used on Ula/Gyda was selected for the kill pill.",

Hole Section Objective : Displace the well to seawater, clean up the well and displace the well to filtered SG sodium chloride brine. Test the reservoir sand zone. Kill the well, pull the test string and P&A the well. Summary : The pits, mixing lines and transfer lines were thoroughly cleaned. 584 bbl new sodium chloride brine at SG was received from land and was filtered to 10 microns and 20 NTU. After filtration, the brine was diluted with drill water to SG. A pressure controlled displacement to seawater was done before the wash pills were pumped and the sodium chloride brine pill was displaced into the well. Due to the quick drop in NTU on the seawater while displacing out the mud, the wash pills were displaced with 600 bbl of seawater and then the filtered SG brine. When the brine displacement was started, the NTU on the seawater 20. 1800 bbl of SG mud was transfered to the supply boat during the displacement to seawater. No mud was stored on the rig during the test. The test was accomplished as per program. A 60 bbl kill pill was made up with saturated sodium chloride brine, N-DRIL HT, BARAPLUG and BARAPLUG Fine. The rheology was adjusted with small amounts of BARAZAN PLUS. An additional volume of SG sodium chloride brine was made up. 1615 bbl mud was received and was diluted with seawater to SG. The rheology of the mud was adjusted with BARAZAN PLUS. This was done in order to have enough volume for the killing operation. The contents of the tubing string was bled down to the flare and the circulating ports were opened. 1/2 times the tubing volume was reverse circulated with the SG sodium chloride brine. 40 bbl kill pill was spotted inside the tubing above the iris valve. One attempt was made to bullhead through the screens. Two bbl were bullheaded on this attempt. The circulating ports were opened and the remaining 38 bbl of the kill pill were displaced to the annulus. An attempt was made to bullhead the kill pill to annulus after the ports were closed and the test string was pulled out of the packer with no apparent injection to the perforations. When the gauges were recovered, it was found that the perforations were taking very small amount of fluid when bullheading the annulus. During the plug and abandonment operation, the perforations were bullheaded with mud and bbl of mud was injected to the formation. The tubing string and annulus were displaced to SG mud. The riser was displaced to SG KCl/NaCl/Polymer mud via the choke line. flow check was performed and the well was dead. The test string was pulled out of the hole with the annulus volume being circulated once. No gas was observed on this circulation.",

There was some unsheared polymer material on the gauge housing below the sand screens. Lab analysis shows that there was no starch (N-DRIL HT) in the polymer. This polymer mass probably came from one of the high viscosity pills which had no N-DRIL HT content. This could have been caused by an unsheared volume of BARAZAN PLUS that settled to bottom or was in the wellhead when the test string was run in the hole. The kill pill was checked for fish eyes (unsheared polymer) constantly during the mixing of the pill. No fish eyes were observed during the mixing and none were found in the sample of the circulated kill pill sent to the Baroid lab. The kill pill sample particle size distribution (PSD) analysis showed that 90% of the kill pill particles were below 90 microns. Approximately 0.5% was greater than 191 microns. Analysis of the material plugging the bottom of the screens and of the material covering the screens indicated that the material collected after the screens were sent to town was sodium chloride (salt i.e BARAPLUG) with minor insoluble contaminants. After killing the well and the test string was pulled out of the hole. cement stinger of 3/8 tubing and 10 stands of 1/2 drill pipe was made up and run to 2945 meters. One string volume was circulated and no gas was found. The perforations were bullheaded one more time with mud. barrels of mud were injected through the perforations. 20 bbl fresh water spacer was pumped, followed by 55 bbl of cement slurry and bbl of spacer. This was displaced with 140 bbl of mud. There were no losses during cement job. The cement string was pulled back to 2466 meters which was approximately 100 meters over the theoretical top of the cement. The string volume was reverse circulated out. Just traces of cement were seen on bottoms up. good pressure test was performed to 2500 psi. The cement stinger was pulled out of the hole. A bridge plug was set in the 5/8 casing at 1090 meters. The 5/8 casing was successfully cut at meters and was pulled out of hole. cement plug was set meters above the bridge plug. The choke and kill lines and the riser were displaced to seawater at the maximum flow rate. 1618 bbl of SG mud was backloaded on to the Far Spirit for injection on the Gyda platform at later date. The DRILI-N-SLIDE content was 0.9% when back loading the mud. Density: The brine for testing had density of SG. The kill pill had density of SG. The well was displaced to SG KCl/NaCl/Pac mud when the well was killed. Mud properties : All mud properties was according to the specifications. Solids control : The four Derrick shakers were dressed with old screens. There were 14 mesh top screens on all four shale shakers. Two of the shale shakers were dressed with 125 mesh bottom screens, one was dressed with 100 mesh bottom screens and the last one was dressed with 84 mesh bottom screens. 29-10-9 BAROID Division of Baroid Corp",
